 == Complete article rewrite proposal == 

 (I have no affiliation with space syntax. I'm an archaeologist, presently working on a PhD in which I use space syntax methods to analyse an ancient settlement plan - which is just a small part of my research) 

 In my view the present article does no justice to what space syntax is, neither do the various comments on this talk page. I realise that most people are familiar with the theory through urban planning, and regard space syntax as an applied method for urban design. The first two sentences of the article are telling:  

 """"The term space syntax encompasses a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. It was conceived by Bill Hillier, Julienne Hanson and colleagues at The Bartlett, University College London in the late 1970s to early 1980s as a tool to help urban planners simulate the likely social effects of their designs."""" 

 First, 'a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configuration is too narrow as a definition. Second, helping urban planners was not at all the reason for developing space syntax.  

 As I see it, space syntax is first and foremost a theory about the relation between space and society. This can be read in the introductory chapter of Hillier & Hanson's the social logic of space (1984). Here (and on a multitude of other places) they argue that the current paradigm found in sociology, social geography, and anthropology to name a few, does not succeed in describing nor explaining the relation between people and their built environment accurately. As Hillier in his writings engages with many influential theories in the social sciences (from 'biggies' as Durkheim to Levi-Strauss and Giddens) his aims are clearly much larger than just providing urban planners with some useful tools.  

 As a matter of fact, the theory having some relevance for urban planning is just an accident, a by-product of the subsequent theory testing on real world situations. At some point they discovered that the integration values of the axial map corresponded well with observed aggregated movement flows of pedestrians and certain land uses (first main insights of these investigations published by Hillier et al in 1993). Many more cases of such studies followed, testing other variables as well, but generally with the same results. So they concluded that axial lines could more or less predict human presence and movement within urban grids. They were initially as puzzled about this as one of the above commentators on this talk page: """"Why should the axial organization of space be so fundamental?"""" Hillier et al wonder in their 1993 article (p. 62). In the years after the hypothesis was developed that this related to the way people cognize space and spatial relations, which, against common assumption, is not primarily determined by metric factors. Recent cognitive research in way finding behaviour is starting to confirm this picture.  

 Also the assertion of user jmanooch that """"SS salesfolks and researchers will claim they can do all these things [solving real urban design problems], but they can't"""" is not really a fair assessment of space syntax in my view. I may of course be wrong here because I have no insight in the workfloor dynamics of the urban planning profession. But this quote of the end of their 1993 article might represent better their view on the usefulness of space syntax for urban design: """"It does not tell designers what to do. It helps them to understand what they are doing"""". 

 Anyway, long story short (too late for that..): this article needs a thorough rewrite.  

 1. It needs to position space syntax theory in relation to other social theories about the relation between space and society  
 2. It needs to represent the history and original aims of space syntax research more faithfully  
 3. It needs to discuss its subsequent reception or uses in various (academic and applied) fields, not only urban design/planning (although clearly, here it has had the most impact)  
 4. And of course the criticism that space syntax theory and method received should be systematically dealt with, including replies by Hillier & others. Now it only contains a very imprecise review of Ratti's 2004{{cite journal|last1=Ratti|first1=C|title=Urban Texture and Space syntax: some inconsistencies|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planni"

 * The phrase """"logical incentive"""" did not clearly communicate what you wanted to a novice reader. Perhaps it could be worded more clearly, in the Nash Equilibrium section. 

 * The cited source makes the point about bank runs happening even when the story is false. This point is worth mentioning separately, because it's counterintuitive to many people. Bank runs happening when the story is true could be mentioned separately, I suppose, but the way it was worded lost most of the force of explaining the counterintutive story. 

 * I still think this article should not contain handwaving references to """"mathematics"""". Stuff like that just looks to me like we're trying to tell the reader """"this stuff is too hard for your poor little brain to understand; you'll just have to trust us"""". 

 * """"If you read the paper"""". I assume you're talking about McAndrews & Roberds 1999 here? If so, I don't see why we need to emphasize that paper so much. That paper is not about bank runs. It's already overemphasized in this article, and should not be emphasized more. This article should not be a general discussion about banking, honest trade, the virtues of the banking system, etc., etc. It should be about bank runs, with only brief mentions of the other stuff (though those brief mentions are important; see below). 

 * Diamond 2007 says """"Bank runs disrupt production because they force banks to call in loans early. This forces the borrowers to disrupt their production."""" This supports the claim in the text that calling in loans is something can banks do in response to bank runs or the threat of bank runs, and that this in turn disrupts the wider economy. 

 * Diamond 2007 says """"the sudden withdrawals can force the bank to liquidate many of its assets at a loss and to fail."""" This supports """"forcing the bank to liquidate its assets at a loss, and eventually to fail""""; it does not support """"liquidated far less quickly"""". We have to stick with claims that supported by the cited sources. 

 * The article is not claiming that the bank would liquidate """"all its assets"""", only some of them. It is following what Diamond 2007 says on this subject. I suppose we should change """"liquidate its assets"""" to """"liquidate many of its assets""""; I've done that. 

 * How about if we change it to """"""""the bank itself may run short of liquidity""""? 

 * I agree that we don't want to go into detail about money creation and so forth, but it's still useful to briefly mention that the economy is helped by having banks that can spread the risk of making loans. This is related to the notion of unpredictability, as the idea of sharing risk is a key notion of the D&D; model. 

 * I disagree that Bank run should avoid all mention of unpredictability. The ordinary reader won't understand the relationship between unpredictability and liquidity. Unpredictability, and the desire to avoid it, is an important reason why bank runs occur. The Diamond paper focuses on this, and is right to do so; we shouldn't second-guess the source.

 Hi, Moe. I'm particularly sensitive about people asking me about the reasons for my votes. So I won't be offended if you are, or decline to answer (heck, I walk that line frequently). It is my hope, though, that our past history will put aside the notion that I'm grilling you over the coals. I found your vote opposing CSCWEM today. I was wondering if you could explain to me what I've missed. I personally voted against him for administratorship, on the basis that he simply did not need it to continue the work he was doing. He still doesn't. And frankly, I oppose most RFAs. In this case, though, I've interacted with him a lot and find him to be (I hate to use the term) a real """"standup kind of guy."""" If you'd deign to explain to me, I'd be most grateful. Thanks, Alex. ... : """

 *""""it has been suggested that this is one of the reasons why the case was cancelled"""" by whom?

 :The article relies way too much on the organisation's website for references rather than other sources. There are no less than five links to the organisation's own website as references, which seem to have been added to the CSP website recently and may fall foul of WP:COI or WP:V. Probably a good idea to edit down """"other actions"""" into """"other claims"""" which contains the proviso The organisation's website claims that... and people can follow the extlink for the CSP site. If we can find independent references we can add them. 

 :The racial basis of the elections is interesting, but ill defined: I'm not sure what having an ancestor of """"direct indigenous Cornish descent"""" means. How many generations back? I note there is a """"Cornish Citizen's Association"""" presumably open to other races. Oddly, no election results or membership (ie names of stannators) of the CSP are published on their site, which is odd, and the method of election is only obliquely referred to, so its hard to know the significance, or how they square with equality legislation. 

 :There does seem to have been some debate on about the electoral system at http://www.cornwall24.co.uk/, but it's gone now. non-citable anyway. The CSP were deccribed on 25 January last in the Lords as """"not exactly a democratic organisation"""".  

 :Incidentally the group does not figure in the media between 1991 and 1999: is the present CSP a revived revived CSP?

 ==14 May 1977== 
 Where did the 14th May 1977 date come from? I believe that it originally had something to do with Daffydd Wigley asking a question in the Commons, and I conducted a search through Hansrad and the contemporary media and found no trace. It's not from the Cornwall County Council site cited. We need a good citation: the Cornwall CC timeline page was compiled by the Cornish Studies Library, Redruth. maybe they know? 

 I took out a para yesterday, and it is back today: As it appears verbatim in another article, and I do not want to get into an edit war, I would suggest that it be edited down to something like:

Perhaps there is some link also to the word shag? There is an lovely old pub outside of Latimer that used to have [may still do, sadly have not been there in a while] old jars on the windowsill labeled """"Rough Shag"""", """"Smooth Shag"""" and """"Mixed Shag"""", this was always a chuckle. 01:21 &

 * It seems like the History of the word fuck contains mostly extraneous trivia, which could all be deleted under WP policy.

 ::It certainly seems to have become an """"every alternative I could find"""" section, not just the truly common ones.

I'd go so far as to put them in the trivia category, rather than appropriate to the core article at all.

 ___ 

  
 The Tanimoto Similarity Coefficient is a generalisation of Jaccard which allows for a similarity to be calculated over multisets. 

 To calculate Tanimoto Similarity, the multisets must first be viewed as vectors. In some arbitrary order, each element of each set is considered as a vector dimension, and the cardinality of the element within that set is used as the magnitude of that dimension in its representative vector. For example, the multisets {apple, apple, pear} and {banana, pear} may be viewed as the vectors (2,0,1) and (0,1,1) respectively if the elements are considered in alphabetical order. 

 Cosine Similarity already gives a similarity coefficient over vectors, bounded in [0,1] for this use. However, the Cosine Similarity of the simple sets {apple, pear} and {banana, pear} yields one half, whereas the Jaccard Coefficient of these sets is one third. 

 The purpose of the Tanimoto Coefficient is thus dual: to give a similarity coefficient over multisets, but also to specialise to the same value as Jaccard Coefficent when only simple sets are considered. The equation identified by Tanimoto (also, anecdotally, by Jaccard nearly 50 years earlier) is: 

  

 Notice that the product and magnitude operators are vector, not set, operators. When two sets (not multisets) are viewed as vectors, the dot product of those vectors is equal to the cardinality of their intersection, and the square of each vector magnitude is the cardinality of the set itself. Thus, the formula immediately specialises to the Jaccard Coefficent for simple sets. Tanimoto  is bounded within [0,1], and the Tanimoto Distance (1 - T(A,B)) is a proper distance metric."

 Hi Bonkers, thank you for reviewing my submission.  However, I am confused by the generic notation that my entry """"should refer to a range of independent, reliable, published sources, not just to materials produced by the creator of the subject being discussed"""".  How independent can I get  these are a range published newspaper and journal articles?  All of the information in the entry is factual.

 == Another msg moved from main namespace D == 

 Yes, but it appears they've gone ahead and deleted it =( and I cut down some of the language to make it NPOV. Thankfully I saved the code and text so it wouldn't be too hard to do it again. 

 This is how it read after the editing: 

 Cougar is an instrumental """"emergency rock"""" group from the USA. However, the members of the band come from different states from Chicago to Milwaukee. Their use of energetic and lively tunes fall somewhere between Four Tet, Tortoise, Fugazi and Nick Drake but has a more pensive feel. Cougar say that what seperates them from """"the post-rock pack"""" is their utilisation of form and texture, which is heavily influenced by sample-based music and experimental/modern classical than indie rock. The band has an eclectic feel to their compositions from the subdued to """"all-out gut-crushing riffs"""". They are currently on the Madison-based record label, Layered Music. Cougar toured the USA on the release of their debut album Law in America during early 2007. They plan to go on tour in the United Kingdom in early May 2007. 

 And as for the image someone (Lotta something) replaced it anyway because it wasn't working (which is odd because it was for me) and I presume she would have made sure the copyright etc was all sound. But hey! It's up to you if you want to try and get it going again or not."""

0	"== Cornucopia == 

 I read the part of this article where Heracles was attributed with tearing off a horn from a river god and it was called the cornucopia. I beg to differ. What ever it was called it was not the same horn that people called the Cornucopia or Horn of Amalthea. For in your article on Zeus, Heracles father, you have him being nursed by either a nymph called Amalthea, or a goat called Amalthea and her horn was the one attributed to the source of the Cornucopia myth. If there were two cornucopias, then this is the first I've heard of it. But as the myths seem to blend together in Europe, we also get Thor who is a bit like Heracles and Woden(Oden) who is a lot like Zeus. And something called a Sampo that Milled Flour, Salt and Gold out of thin air.  
 For each of these Myths we also have varying stories with each town that celebrates the gods and their deeds. And while Hercules has been attributed with many many deeds and gifts, his father was the one associated with the Cornucopia, not him."

 Greetings Saguamundi 

 I have been asked for a comment regarding the stub templates used for Turkish Cypriots, and I notice that you show an interest in these articles. I am the person that originally tagged the Cypriots as Europeans rather than Asians and I do of course agree that the island of Cyprus geographically is an extension of Anatolia and consequently a part of Asia, but I believe that most editors and readers will be more likely to associate the island with Europe rather than with Asia, so this was the reason for sorting the stub templates the way I did. Originally, we just used  for all articles, but the material became so big that we broke it up by continent. I suspect that a stub template for Middle East politicians will eventually be split off from the  and if this happens I would like to avoid the risk of having to tag Cypriot material with templates for both Europe, Asia, and the Middle East all at the same time. ) AFAIK, WP:WSS has, simply for practical purposes, categorized Cyprus under Europe, but if you feel strongly about this issue, may I suggest that you take the matter up with WP:WSS so this issue can be debated and so we can ensure that all Cypriot material will be grouped the same way nomatter which solution is chosen?

 IntroductionThe Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) grew out of the longstandingbelief of its founder, Mr. Landon T. Clay, in the value of mathematicalknowledge and its centrality to human progress, culture, and intellectuallife. Discussions over some years with Professor Arthur Jaffe helped shapeMr. Clay’s ideas of how the advancement of mathematics could best be sup-ported. These discussions resulted in the incorporation of the Institute onSeptember 25, 1998, under Professor Jaffe’s leadership. The primary objec-tives and purposes of the Clay Mathematics Institute are “to increase anddisseminate mathematical knowledge; to educate mathematicians and otherscientists about new discoveries in the field of mathematics; to encouragegifted students to pursue mathematical careers; and to recognize extraordi-nary achievements and advances in mathematical research.” CMI seeks to“further the beauty, power and universality of mathematical thinking.”Very early on, the Institute, led by its founding scientific board — AlainConnes, Arthur Jaffe, Edward Witten, and Andrew Wiles — decided toestablish a small set of prize problems. The aim was not to define newchallenges, as Hilbert had done a century earlier when he announced his listof twenty-three problems at the International Congress of Mathematiciansin Paris in the summer of 1900. Rather, it was to record some of the mostdifficult issues with which mathematicians were struggling at the turn of thesecond millennium; to recognize achievement in mathematics of historicaldimension; to elevate in the consciousness of the general public the factthat, in mathematics, the frontier is still open and abounds in importantunsolved problems; and to emphasize the importance of working towardsolutions of the deepest, most difficult problems.After consulting with leading members of the mathematical community,a final list of seven problems was agreed upon: the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, the Hodge Conjecture, the Existence and Uniqueness Prob-lem for the Navier–Stokes Equations, the Poincaré Conjecture, the P ver-sus NP problem, the Riemann Hypothesis, and the Mass Gap problem forQuantum Yang–Mills Theory. A set of rules was established, and a prizefund of US$7 million was set up, this sum to be allocated in equal parts tothe seven problems. No time limit exists for their solution.vii

 There was a common wave editing program that could do alteration to a sound track to add binaural beats to a waveform. I've tried it, and it works, but it's not much of a magic behind it. 
 My experience is that it works if you select a comfortable audio track to relax to which is about 5-10 minutes. Then make a binaural beat to slowly turn down the mix frequency so that 
 delta frequencies are inducted only at half way and the inducted frequency slightly drops towards that goal. Finally, listen to it in a relaxed position (e.g. lying on a sofa with 
 headphones on). You should feel a comfortable relaxation as soon as the sounds seem to stop being disordinate between the stereo speakers and seem to blend into a common rythm. 
 This is of course no magic: You'll need a tune to which you can relax anyways. You'll need to be in a position to relax anyways. You'll need to take the time to relax. And it won't 
 do wonders (e.g. having only slept a few hours a night and waiting for the magical refreshing effect). But in the aforementioned circumstances it helps quite a bit to refresh, at least for me."

 == Jerusalem in the Quran == 

  
 , please stop mentionig that Jerusalem as a text is not mentioned in Quran. The Arabs had several names to Jerusalem, Eliya, Bayt al Maqdis, Urshaleem (Canaanite not Hebrew by the way) and so on. God himself, decided to call it his way! This way of calling Jerusalem has been mentioned in Hadith. That is after the Quran is recited from the mouth of Prophet Muhammad and after it is written by the writers, he pause then he say a Hadith (not quran) again out of his mouth, saying that this is in Bayt al-Maqdiss, this is here, this is there, etc... This is the Islamic Scripture, Quran + Hadith. Quran without Hadith may mean nothing! After all, the Quran mentioned that a muslims should Pray, but it never mentioned how. This has been elaborated more in the Hadith! Certainly, it is Jerusalem as an area that has been blessed in the Quran. Mecca and Medina as cities were not blessed explicitly as done for Jerusalem. However, Mecca and Medina were decalared Sanctuaries and banned on non muslims. Jerusalem is not! For example, even though al-Aqsa mosque has been also named as the Noble Sanctuary, per the strict Islamic law, al-Aqsa mosque is not a sanctuary. A muslim sacntuary is a place where one may not cut a tree, nor kill an animal, and no nonmuslims are allowed to pass in! So you see Sharmi1, that there are quite so many things here that are missing and frankly I do not see your edits are getting the big picture. We should work together not against each others please! Also, you may want to read this paper Jerusalem in the Quran. If it helps, I may send the paper to anyone who likes to his email! At least, seventy time reference to Jerusalem is mentioned with different approaches, etc... 

 Finally, Moses was mentioned 122 times, Muhammad 4 times. Mecca was mentioned on once in the Quran as Mecca. Once it was mentioned as Bekka, and that is it. It was not mentioned explicitly in the verse 17:1 nor Jerusalem was. But immediately it was mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad. So you see, the Islamic scripture is one package, Quran looses much of its meaning if Hadith is excluded. Also, there are hundreds of Hadiths talking explicitly about Bayt al-Maqdis. 

 I would like also to mention that the night journey is not the reason for the importance of Jerusalem in Islam. In fact, many Hadiths regarding Jerusalem and references in Quran were made even before the night journey! The matter is that Quran mentions that Muhammad is not preaching for a new message, but he is reviving the message of the previous prophets, even if many of them happen to be Israelites. In fact, the Quran talks about them, possible half of the Quran is only talking about Moses, Jesus, solmon, David, Abraham, Adam, Zakariya, Yahya John, etc...... 

 Our job here at WikiPedia is not really discussing our believes. Every one is entitled to his belief, but we are to report accuratley documented sources that talks about the holiness of Jerusalem for these religions. We are not and should not put the faith of each others down, please. This does not make sense. The article should clearly mentions the basics of why each religion glorifies Jerusalem. There is no point in tryint to show who glorifies Jerusalem more, it is irrilevant and does not make much sense anyway. Finally, some body mentioned third holiest stuff. Well, Jerusalem is called in Arabic Third of the two Sanctuaries. (Arabic: ثالث الحرمين; Translit: thālith al-ḥaramayn) . No other site is called this way in Arabic. this has been translated in third holiest in english. The term ثالث الحرمين has been used to refer to this mosque at the early times of Islam. 

 Finally, the word masjid in Arabic means a prostration site. Although the english word mosque is translated from masjid, the Arabic word masjid may refer to a proper building (proper mosque) or it may refer to a site where prayers are permitted. Certainly the whole earth is made a mosque for muslims. It should be mentioned that Jews prostrated only in the Temple, and not any where else. Prophet Muhammad in a Hadith said that the whole earth is a masjid for a muslim, and whenever the time for prayers came, pray! 

 You should also note another term in Arabic (Jamii) which translates exactly to a congregation building. In general, in the Islamic word, when they talk about a mosque they use the word Jamii rather than using the word masjid. Jamii cannot refer to a site, but usually to a constructed building.

If she wants the article to be what she wants, then that's fine, she (and her friends?) can have the article. What she's doing anyway is voicing the opinions that everybody, including me, has while watching the show. But obviously, that's bias not very Wikipedia-like. Anyway, with that said, I don't plan on turning her in to the Sock puppetry noticeboard.

How many more thousands of words are needed to get us to a conclusion? I don't think we'll ever get there without active mediation. One lesson we've learned is that getting a consensus among only some of the editors is useless if, at the last moment, another editor suddenly pops in and wants to start over from scratch. So for a Skype chat to be effective it would have to involve all of the active editors, editors who are spread across the globe. Rather than more words faster, could fewer words discussed more slowly succeed? That is, you putting out a question and waiting for everyone to agree to a formulation before moving on to the next point, slowly building up material with complete, explicit consensus among all active parties.

 Would you - or any non-Commonwealth English speaking talkpage stalkers - be willing to offer your opinions on this one? Basically, the standard British (and Australian, Canadian etc) way of differentiating """"traditional city"""" from """"larger modern city that grew around it is"""" to use """"City of..."""" for the original city, and """"Greater..."""" for the modern city ((City of Manchester/Greater Manchester, Île de la Cité/Paris aire urbaine, City of Sydney/Greater Sydney, City of Toronto/Greater Toronto and so on). While the """"formal city""""/""""broader area named after it"""" formulation certainly exists in the US (the Las Vegas strip isn't formally in Las Vegas, Miami Beach isn't formally in Miami, etc); the problem is that while the meaning of """"City of"""" will be immediately obvious to Brianboulton's concerned that City of London will be misunderstood. Unfortunately, there isn't really an obvious simplification; London is an agglomeration of multiple cities that have merged together, that happens to have been named after one of the older cities, and the City is neither the oldest nor the most important part - just the part that happened to give its name to the remainder - so none of the usual """"historic centre of"""" or """"the core of"""" formulations apply.

 :Wikipedia values verifiability and notability over truth and general relevance. In my opinion, the minimum requirements to include a source such as this would be that the author should be a notable authority or subject matter expert (as established by reliable third-party sources), and his site should clearly identify that the author is indeed that same notable authority. As it is, I didn't find any information in the source that confirmed the identity of the author as the Gerald Jones, only as a Gerald Jones. This probably seems like nit-picking semantics but for verifiability the source really needs to be explicit on this, or we risk false attribution which reduces the usefulness of the encyclopaedia. Unfortunately, at the moment, my interpretation of the relevant policies is that there's no way to include the source (in its current state) in the article."

 == """"Cleaned-up"""" Biography == 
 I've read a lot of Wikipedia biographies for writers, actors, directors and producers and mentions of coworkers who they had significant affairs with are commonly included (all sourced, of course). Bergman's name comes up in several of them but aside from her affair and later marriage to Rossellini, this information is not included and, I'm guessing, it consciously deleted when it is edited in.  

 Affairs between actors or actors and directors were common in Hollywood of the 1920s-1950s and it seems sanitized to omit their mention here, especially when mention of Bergman occurs on the other person's Wikipedia page. This isn't gossip, it helps readers understand Hollywood culture of the time and also can impact how one views films that arise out of off-screen romances.  

 I'm not sure whether some editor wants to preserve a virtuous image of Bergman but she is deceased and considering how prevalent they were, I don't think knowledge of her affairs would tarnish this image. I'm not going to get into an editing war but I just wanted to cast a vote for including this dimension of her personal life in her biography. This information already exists on other Wiki pages and it makes sense that it would appear on this bio as well.   """

 an equivalent point on a curve with a defined radius r, being an arc defined by chord AB. 

 In terms of possible transformations of straight to curve, I'm not yet understanding it all fully. 

 What I'd like to have is some functions  as follows  

 i) 'slide' , that is a  translation P(x,z) -> P'(x',z),  where P' is on a curve defined by a chord AB. (Note the z value doesn't change.) 

 ii)'bend' , translates a pint P(x,z) on chord AB to P'(x',z'), where P' is on the arc defined by AB.   
 Distances parrallel to AB (before the transformation) get scaled, whereas distances perpendicular to AB are rotated. 

 iii)'curve', translates a point P(x,z)->P'(x',z'), where P' is on the arc defined by AB. 
 Distances parallel to AB (before the transformation) become 'arc lengths' w.r.t arc AB.

Crombie is an excellent historian but you should be aware that he is pushing a personal agenda that is no longer accepted in mainstream history of science. Crombie is the strongest defender of the thesis that the Scientific Revolution took place in the High Middle Ages and not in the 17th century.

0	"== Detail on Islamic Polygamy == 

 Muslim polygamy, in practice and law, differs greatly throughout the Islamic world.  Whereas, in some Muslim countries, polygamy may be fairly common, in most others, it is often rare or non-existent.   While Muslim polygamy may be mainly found in traditionalist Arab cultures such as Saudia Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it is either extremely rare or even banned outright in secular Arab states like Lebanon and non-Arab Muslim countries such as Turkey and Malaysia. 

 In Muslim countries where polygamy does occur, there are certain core fundamentals found in common among most of them.  According to traditional Islamic law, a man may take up to four wives, and each of those wives must have her own property, assets, and dowry.  Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.  Thus, Muslim polygamy is traditionally restricted to wealthy men, and in some countries it is illegal for a man to marry multiple wives if he is unable to afford to take care of each of them properly.  In such Muslim countries where polygamy is still commonplace and legal, Muslim polygamists live openly among the rest of their society at large. 
 This section is disputed. The extra detail does not seem to be pushing a POV to me - please propose alternative language here.   

 == Muslims & traditionalist cultures === 
 Polygamy, and laws concerning polygamy, differ greatly throughout the Islamic world and form a very complex and diverse background from nation to nation. Whereas in some Muslim countries it may be fairly common, in most others it is often rare or non-existent. However, there are certain core fundamentals which are found in most Muslim countries where the practice occurs. According to traditional Islamic law, a man may take up to four wives, and each of those wives must have her own property, assets, and dowry. Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband. Thus, polygamy is traditionally restricted to wealthy men, and in some countries it is illegal for a man to marry multiple wives if he is unable to afford to take care of each of them properly. 

 In the modern Islamic world, polygamy is mainly found in traditionalist Arab cultures, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for instance, whereas in secular Arab states like Lebanon and non-Arab Muslim countries, Turkey and Malaysia for example, it is either extremely rare or even banned outright. In traditionalist cultures where polygamy is still commonplace and legal, Muslim polygamists do not separate themselves from the society at large, since there would be no need as each spouse leads a separate life from the others. 
 This section is also disputed. It seems to me that Muslims and Mormons do not share alot of common ground in how they identify potential partners so I would put them under different sections; however, I am open to proposed modifications to the above."
0	""" 
 To a large degree, this discussion of the use of the word """"effortless"""" is one of semantics. I can vouch for the observations of  above. Maharishi used the word effortless repeatedly to describe the TM technique. On one or two occasions that I witnessed, when pressed by a questioner, he admitted that some faintest attention is employed, but continued to insist that no effort is involved. In the West, effort means """"trying."""" It is not a faint thing such as Maharishi was describing as faintest attention or """"effortless effort."""" So he used the word repeatedly to signify that no trying to do anything is involved in TM. It is a simple, easy thing that requires only faint attention, no effort. This is not a question of academic definitions. It is a practical question of how to practice the technique. If  has some reference about the TM technique specifically, then we can examine that in the context of this section and determine if the information is appropriate to add to the article. Otherwise, this discussion is diverging from what seems to be the main intent of the articleto convey information about the TM technique as seen by it's originator and as instructed to and practiced by those who do the technique.

 This is actually my first contribution to wikipedia and I am still learning the very basics of how it works. To put your mind to rest, I found and added references which supported the statements I added (there is actually a lot more information on that site which can be added, and I will do so later). As far as the comment regarding the function of the QA trigger, I am unable to find a reference to what I am saying. Regardless, what I am stating is fact, as you know, and I feel that it is essential that this information be included on this wiki page. All other information on the page leads the reader to believe that the gun is only cocked when the striker is protruding from the slide, which is not true on the QA variant. This can lead to mishandling of the firearm by an inexperienced user, and that can obviously lead to injury or death. I hope that you agree with me."

0	"Hi Qwyrxian Sorry haven't been back to this article for a while. In answer to Man vyi I would never attempt to argue against tax exempt imports or deny that this entry should only give the facts , but that was never the issue that was controversial here. Much of what was speculation on the LVCR page is now turning into fact as the EU make it clear that the Channel Islands use of LVCR is an illegal abuse of a tax relief as distinct from a genuine tax exempt import.Whilst some have argued that's an 'opinion' its an opinion that was always based upon the facts of the legislation. However because the EU hasn't tackled the illegal use of LVCR its not been possible to easily reference that 'fact' and establish it's not just an opinion.  This has been the main problem with this page as some users have decided that what's illegal is a legitimate practice just because it hasn't been stopped. That position has tainted every part of the LVCR entry and highlights a weakness in Wikipedia, which appears to assume something cannot be deemed illegal even if it clearly breaches a piece of legislation. As a result those who are carrying on the illegal activity have undue influence over the article. Just read the history and see some of the nonsense that's been posted on this entry in the past and you will see.All of these pro- CI LVCR comments have been posted by those with a vested interest in the ongoing illegal activity.      

 How can I be so sure of this ? Well I am party to information that I can't make public. Once that information is in the public domain (i.e a fact in Wikipedia terms) then with proper references I'll go through and alter this article as it will all then be just a case of stating those public facts. What's coming out of the EU shortly will remove all of the controversy from this entry which as you know has been a battlefield of opinion for the last few years!  

 The article will then be discussing LVCR and The Channel Islands in terms of a practice that has been abolished, which will shrink the articles size and importance considerably removing any debate!

 To remove any questions about the sources -  
 Ehrenpreis and Ferguson are two leading Swift scholars. Ferguson's work dealt primarily with Swift's relationship with Ireland, and Ehrenpreis's was a more complete biography. They were contemporaries and wrote many articles as response to the other. They are still highly regarded. Between the two, all of the sources pre-1900 are used by them. Furthermore, both base their work on the Drapier's Letters on """"Wood's Halfpence"""" by Goodwin, which was one of the first modern histories of the controversy.  

 Previous histories of the controversy come from Lecky's Leaders of Irish Public Opinions and Ireland in the Eighteenth Century, Froude's English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century and Leslie Stephen's Swift. These sources would also be added, except that they deal more with the controversy as a whole, and would be fitting only for a page on such. Goodwin is dealing with Swift's involvement, and relies on Monck Mason's History, Craik's Swift, Coxe's Walpole. Ehrenpreis and Ferguson apply their own interpretation to the sources Goodwin choses. 

 More recent scholars, such as Carl Daw, follow primarily what has been stated by Ehrenpreis (Ehrenpreis three volume work on the matter is, by far, the longest work). New critics, such as Richard Cook, abandon the previous scholarly works for a close reading. However, all of them regard Scott's and Davis's editions as being complete. And still, Ehrenpreis's work is still seen as the main authority on the subject.   """

 Roman Polanski does not belong in this category statutory rapists, because he is a rapist whose victim just happened to be a minor.  """"Statutory Rape"""" can be a somewhat minor crime, brought perhaps by angry parents when their daughter has eloped with a young man even though the local statutes say she's not quite old enough to make that decision, and then she goes on to marry the fellow and maybe be upstanding citizens together.  According to the judge and jury, Roman Polanski gave her Quaalues and alchohol to disable her ability to fight him off and then raped and sodomized her anally.  The drugs did not stop her from protesting and fighting him anyway and she did not consent.  This would have been rape at any age.  This is rape plain and simple, and so he should be on the list of rapists, simple as that, not in the same category as, for exammple, a female high school teacher who carried on a sexual romance with one her her eighteen year old male students and the other things people did to earn their membership in that category.

That's the entire point of having reliable sourcing, so that we are not simply taking information that may be popularized yet wrong.  I mean, wow.

 ::::I agree it's not obviously relevant; until we start tripping over the issue of falsifiability as we have several times recently with various editors rewriting some of that second paragraph.  It is a bit of a stumbler.  If, however, a consensus can be reached about how to phrase it as introductory material in a meaningful way, whatever language is chosen can be maintained with an occasional checkup on the language by the participating editors.  In my figuring of it, the way it was written before was a bit clumsy and largely indefensible on the basis that we'd already said it effectively, because we hadn't quite said it effectively in that paragraph.  I imagine there is some way of reasonably saying this in the article, as yet undetermined, that will ring true to those regular editors who understand the basic problem, and still explain reasonably well to the previously uninitiated reader of the material. Right now the first sentence of the paragraph is quite reasonable in my opinion (""""...Popper proposed the additional criterion of falsifiability""""), which factors in those theories that are dependent on coherence rather than outright falsifiability. I trust with some further discussion and a bit of experimenting that it'll get done for the rest of that paragraph.

0	"==Begg - main points and different map== 
 Just browsing these at present, but on this page of his Statement of Facts a very different British claim-line is shown from the one on the map currently on this article.  Begg's main points of difference are that the original treaty (1825) specified Cape Chacon, not Cape Muzon, as the start of the boundary line, and that the terms Portland Channel and Portland Canal were deliberately confused by the US, with the meaning of Portland Channel in 1825 referring to Clarence Strait, not the Portland Canal which was unknown at the time; Etolin Island he notes as having originally been Duke of York Island, also.  Begg wrote three treatises on this, most with all the same points, though successively in 1896, 1900 and 1902, all official reports with two (1896 and 1902) written to federal and provincial cabeint ministers, respectively.  Another item in Begg that's passed over here and in other histories is the Ukase of 1821 which claimed to 51 degrees N and also involved the Bering Sea Arbitration.  The Ukase looks to need its own article, as it also invovles the rights of the Russian Orthodox Church in the region.

I believe that the website is gone now (will double check that though), but it was a very singular situation, since images such as those are usually the property of news agencies and/or photographers.

 == Personal Attack, silly vandalism == 

 Hi Alison, 

 User  inserted stupid statment here saying that the Gulf is also called """"The American Gulf"""" in Arabic. I reverted his nonsense difined as Silly Vandalism and  him in his Talk Page not to do so as he is established user in WP and supposed to know this before inserting jokes in articles. 

 *Firstly, and just for the sake of """"revenge"""", he tag my Talk Page with meaningless rubbish  without pointing why it has been used for, which is clear Personal Attack and damaging in my Talk Page Wikipedia:No talk page spamming. 
 *Then, he deleted the Warning from his Talk Page  that is clear vandalism according to Wikipedia:Removing warnings. 

 So, I would like to to take an action in: 
 # Removing the trash he filled my Talk Page with 
 # Punish him of doing so 
 # Punish him of removing a legal warning of vandalism according to WP rules, for special the Silly Vandalism. 

 Kind regards,  """

 == re: Jeff Dunham == 

 I assure you my edits were made in good faith. I meant to correct information that is misleading, and remove information that is irrelevant. 
 1. I miswrote the cite to the FAA's website. Information on pilot certificates is public information available to anyone, but unfortunately, you can't link directly to it. There is an intermediate step where you have to provide some information about yourself, then search for the pilot in question. If there's a way to write a proper cite to web data without linking directly to it, let me know. 
 2. Saying Jeff Dunham's helicopter is """"unlicensed by the Federal Aviation Administration"""" is false. If it were, he would be committing a federal crime by flying it. His helicopter, like all homebuilt aircraft registered in the US, carries a Special Airworthiness Certificate in the Experimental category. 
 3. Quoting Dunham's appearance on Fast Living verbatim saying that """"he can fly them up to 600 feet in the air, and up to 90 miles an hour"""" is misleading. It implies that this is all that his helicopter is capable of, when in fact it is capable of far more. Besides, the performance of the helicopter is irrelevant to this article, which is why I deleted it. The fact that he has built and flies his own RotorWay should be enough. 
 Given this information, do what you will with it. Protecting an article from vandalism and addition of unsourced material is a good thing. Restricting all edits to those that parrot various media outlets verbatim takes it too far. It results in a lot of information being taken out of context which in turn misleads the reader.

Many of our articles link to the site. A deletion would to me show a deficiency in our notability guidelines, but other than stamping my feet I don't know how I would wikilawyer for its defense. As a place where classics meets the public, it was for many years almost unique, and certainly pioneering. I often find myself thinking how extraordinary it was for Bill Thayer, who wasn't born of the cyber-generation, to have seized so early on the concept that the internet could make these kinds of resources available to the public—and to assume a public existed for them. I benefitted so much from it when my daughter was little and I was home with her, and even though other resources have appeared, if I want a Loeb translation I'll always prefer LacusCurtius if it's available there, in the hope of some """"Thayer's Notes.""""  I used his texts to create my own annotated editions at a time when he was just about the only source for something like Pliny, whose chapter on gemstones, I may have confessed under torture before, I once spent a week perusing. So I have a completely addled and non-neutral appreciation of LacusCurtius, as if it were an astonishingly generous gift for me personally. 

 :I suppose what I'm saying is that there should be some historian of scholarship out there who recognizes these content pioneers (Roger Pearse's Tertullian site is another) who almost singlehandedly put up masses of texts when Google was a brand new toy for the masses, and who understood instinctively how to add functionality online in ways we take for granted now—and if nobody's bothered to write up this kind of """"history of the web for traditional humanities"""" yet, then it needs to be done. They're like Cahill's Irish monks saving civilization, or at least helping morph it along. (Incidentally, our article History of Google strangely lacks a sociological component almost entirely, as if one were describing the growth of a widget maker instead of a revolution in how information is sought and acquired.) I shall begin loin-girding to defend LacusCurtius at once, should the need arise. This site regards it as one of the """"best-loved and most heavily used online resources for Classics research,"""" along with Perseus, which I'll do almost anything to avoid using, though it doesn't load as slowly as it used to, and sometimes I can even coax it to offer up text by the book instead of paragraph.

My own view is that there's actually too much information here as it is, and that lots of it is too US-centric. I think there's two ways the article could move forward: 

 (a) Remove all the sales and certifications columns, and simply leave the chart positions. This would lead to less vandalism (sales figures on this article are changed daily to unsourced numbers) and make the article less prone to sourcing disputes. The removed data is reproduced in each album's own entry or in the article on MC certifications, which seems more appropriate. I'd personally favour this approach. 

 (b) Merge the tabular data from the MC certifications article into this one, so it maintained sales and cert data for the US, but also included (properly sourced) information for other reasons, to reduce the US bias in the listing.

  	 In my opinion, the best thing that could happen is for everyone to move over here for a few weeks until the only thing to be heard on CARM is crickets chirping.  (That's pretty much what is happenign right now anyway). 

 To be quite honest, I think that forum is too stifling anyway.  I don't really intend to moderate this forum unless it gets horribly out of control.  Even then, I think the worst case scenario would be to just move really extreme posts to a 'flame' thread so people could view them if they care or not. 

 Personally, I don't give a shit if people cuss from time to time.  I don't think a bunch of fucking cursing is really all that mother fucking necessary, but it doesn't fucking kill a person now does it? 

 Whatever happens, I will keep this forum alive for a while until CARM straightens itself out.

 == F**k the Falun Gong == 

 In the above heading ** stands for """"or"""", """"Fork"""" being a traditional term of endearment used in many native cultures of the Mariana Trench 

 But seriously, I've had it up to here with Falun Gong stooges trying to masquerade as good faith editors.  

 """"But your information is totally POV!"""" """"Oh, no, thats because of the source material! I'm just retarded and couldn't see that the source material was POV!""""  

 """"But your claims are unverifiable!"""" """"Oh, yes, they are, Clear Wisdom Net and the Epoch Times, being the bastions of objective journalism that they are, verify these!"""" 

 """"But the Communists can't possibly execute 200,000,000 Falun Gong members..."""" """"Of course they can! Epoch Times says so! And anyway you're a Communist stooge!"""" 

 """"But Li Hongzhi is a homophobic racist lunatic... look at his speeches!"""" """"No, your interpretation of his words are WRONG! When he said he hated gays, he meant he didn't like happy people. When he said he hated blacks, he meant he hated black pieces in Chess...""""    

 ==Suppression of FG page== 
 Hi, the following sentence is kind of awkward.  “Falun Gong practitioners have claimed that the Zhongnanhai protest, the event that triggered the response from the Chinese government, was their response to government suppression.”  First of all, many people do not know what the Zhongnanhai protest is and when it happened, hence I restored the paragraph that explains it.  If this event is covered later in the article then it is that section needs to be removed.  Secondly, note the italic part of the sentence above, can Wikipedia say that this event triggered response (ban) from the Chinese government?  I don’t think we know enough to say that.    

 == Image:Buying Tickets.png == 
 Thanks for uploading Image:Buying Tickets.png. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please: 

 # Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template. 
 # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. 

 Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself. 

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  ''''''  

 == A new approach to the Falun Gong article == 

 Hello Colipon, please see the Falun Gong talk page and state your opinion about my proposal concerning a strict source policy. I think it's worth serious consideration. You know that the situation is tense, so we really need to find a common set of rules that is absolutely fair to all parties. In my opinion, the three-strike rule requires too much devotion to Wikipedia, and thus discriminates against a large group of editors. -

If I had enough time/energy, or better yet if someone else were to figure out where the discussion should be started (and actually start it), I would be happy to join in as well.   
 :::The reason I chuckle, is when I do have a strong feeling, and object similarly, I always meet w/the wp:othercrapexists argument.  And then I argue that that is a fine argument, as long as it's not my only one.  And then the other party disagrees with me anyway.  And unless I want an edit war/ANI, I have to essentially walk away from it all as we end up not agreeing.  It barely matters what the issue is (though the last I recall having this on, and caring, was whether it was ok to use a band album cover on the band page ... answer:no ... despite it often being the case, where I wanted to follow suit, editors lined up to delete it). 
 :::One last point/question.  Why don't you believe that there is danger in having one's signature out and about?  Seriously - if I were a ceo charged with signing an annual report that would be public record, I would have my secretary do it.  Now, with SEC filings online, there is some degree of risk that can't be avoided, but since banks still use signature cards, and checks can be mocked up, I think this may be a real world risk.

 The number 30 was used by myself for very good reasons.  You yourself have stated that 29 matrix schemes are still operational - a figure drawn I believe from the matrixwatch.org website.  As my own matrix scheme - www.cyberama.net - is operational but classified as non-operational by matrixwatch.org (why I do not know!), then 30 must be the minimum number of matrix schemes operational currently.  As stated before, this is a conservative number - I personally believe that there are far more but this would be unverifiable without some intense work verifying all known matrix scheme domains.   

 To include the number of matrix sites that have ceased trading would be hard if not impossible - there is no proof that any domains that would be claimed by anyone were ever matrix schemes.  If domains have expired, there is no evidence that either they ever existed or what their content consisted of.  Therefore, I feel it is unverifiable to state any given number of matrix schemes that may have ceased trading.  Stating that many have ceased trading is the best solution, in my opinion.   

 In my mind, the term """"operational"""" regarding a website would mean that it was viewable and that it is possible for it to operate.  Therefore, any matrix scheme that is able to take payment should be regarded as being operational.  www.dictionary.com defines the term as, """"Fit for proper functioning; ready for use"""".  I would have to say that as both Arzel personally and matrixwatch.org have stated that they 'know' 29 matrix schemes are operational, it is silly for them now to backstep and try and say that there is no way to 'know' these sites are operational.   

 Would it be of additional help in the History section to include details on Gotmatrix?  This was also a very well-known matrix scheme that is apparently still operational and trading - and is one of the older websites too.  Greg, the owner, is still answering emails - when he chooses!

 *Oppose. Primary topic exists to serve those users who use the """"Go"""" button. I strongly believe that to be a tiny proportion of readers, and the vast majority of people arriving at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester will have come from an external search provider (eg Google) or a direct link to the article (a wikilink or a link from another website). This undermines the value of page views as a metric - you cannot infer anything about the number of misdirected readers, who got here by """"Go"""". 
 :The page one results of a Google UK search for Worcester exclusively relate to the English city, and one of the hits is this article.

I don't trust Google.com to ignore my location). In other words, UK and US readers using links or Google already arrive at the correct article. 
 :What will happen to the vast majority of users if this page is moved? Wikilinks to this article will be temporarily degraded. External links to this article will be degraded for a longer period, some permanently. 
 :As for external search - we can see what will happen, by comparing to Durham. The page one results of a Google UK search exclusively relate to the English city, except there is a link to a WP disambig instead of the WP article.

Meanwhile a Google.com search in the US is unaffected, and continues to be exclusively for Durham, NC, including the wiki article. 
 :I would expect the same here in event of a pagemove. This will result in zero benefit to US users, except that small proportion who try their luck with """"Go"""". It will significantly degrade the utility of this article to UK users, as they will no longer even see this article in a Google search (for at least a month).

 ==Viridias's misrepresentations== 
 I am not aware of any source that says Hitler took """"sundry remedies"""" for flatulence brought on by his vegetarianism. This story of Hitler as a vegetarian has the look and feel of an apocryphal folk tale intended to turn Hitler into a spiritual figure, according to Payne's opinion represented in the article, an opinion that the proposers are using to bolster their argument for a move.  You're engaging in the fallacy of rotten apples by claiming Payne is an unreliable source about Hitler's diet simply because he made an error about a separate incident that has nothing to do with his observations about Hitler's diet. We already have other sources indicating Hitler ate sausages, ham, and caviar between 1931-1945. If you wanted to refute Payne, all you would have to do is show that Hitler didn't drink beer or wine, eat sausages or caviar or keep a mistress.  You can't do that, so you are reduced to attacking his credibility on a different subject, which is essentially distracting us from the issue at hand.  Historian Robert N. Proctor supports the notion that Hitler ate meat, so Payne isn't alone in questioning the perception of Hitler's """"vegetarianism"""" over the reality of his fondness for eating meat.  Payne's claim that """"Hitler's asceticism played an important part in the image he projected over Germany"""" is also followed up on by Proctor: 

 ::::::::::Hitler's vegetarianism was remarked on prior even to 1933, however, when the Führer-to-be's personal asceticism was held up as the model Nazi lifestyle. Foreigners eventually took note, recording also some apparent backsliding.  Otto D. Tolischus in 1937 in the New York Times pointed out that the Führer was a vegetarian who """"does not drink or smoke"""" but who also """"occassionally relishes a slice of ham"""" along with delicacies such as caviar and chocolates.  Postwar observers have often—and understandably—used this to question whether Hitler was in fact a vegetarian. 

 ::::::::::[...] 

 ::::::::::Hitler was indeed, for the most part, a vegetarian—though he did occassionally allow himself a dish of meat. Gestapo chief Rudolf Diels after the war wrote that HItler would sometimes eat Bavarian liver dumplings (Leberknödel), but only when they were prepared by his photographer friend, Heinrich Hoffmann.  The New York Times mentioned ham and caviar, but HItler was also said to have enjoyed squab...Hitler is said to have been unable to tolerate the idea of animals' being killed for human consumption, but at least one author has countered that this was an image deliberately crafted to popularize the German leader as kind and gentle.  Animal-rights historians Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax have noted that both claims may be true. 

 ::::::::::It therefore appears that Payne's claims remain intact and the notion that there is a legitimate dispute over Hitler's vegetarianism is repeated by a respected historian of science.  This is essentially what is driving the editors who are asking for a change of article name and it appears to be a complaint backed by evidence, not unreliable fringe sources as you maintain.    

 As I said above, you respond by simply producing Walls of Text designed to bludgeon editors into silence, and you do so by systematically misrepresenting sources and also misrepresenting what other editors have said in order to create fake """"answers"""". I find this approach to dealing with any topic morally and intellectually repugnant, as it stops proper debate and proper evaluation of sources. All you care about is looking like a """"winner"""" on a talk page, no matter what cheap tricks you use. Even your first sentence has no relevance to anything (""""I am not aware of any source that says Hitler took """"sundry remedies"""" for flatulence brought on by his vegetarianism"""") Yes, he took remedies fotr flatulence. Whether it was specifically brought on by his vegetarianism is  arguable, but wholly irrelevant. Agument by misdirection. Payne is unreliable in this matter beause he is a potboiler biographer, not an expert, but also because this - and other books of his - are known to contain egregious errors. That is one of the ways we determine reliability. Payne is simply talking crap when he says that Hitler's vegetarianism was a fiction invented by Goebbels. If Hitler tucked into Steak and Kindney pies every night, he might have an argument, but the fact that his diet was vegetarian is a reality commented upon by ''nume"

0	::You are right, Jerome, and I apologize for not having been entirely clear (or, I must avow, not entirely kowledgeable). On the one hand, however, I am not so sure about the statistical importance of three- vs four-part writing in the 14th century (unless I am mistaken, Vitry often wrote in four parts, and Machaut did the same for his Mass and many other works). On the other hand, what seems to become a norm is that even five-parts (or more) appears to involve two or more parts of the same tessitura: let's say that four-tessituras writing may have become one of the norms. (Machaut's mass, on reflection, seems to be in four parts but three tessituras.) You are right and the situation is complex: instrumental quartets of the early 16th century (e.g. in Virdung) involved only three tessituras, etc. Let's say that all this deserves comments in the article that we may have in mind (rather than Barber shop quartets singing in unison!). —

 Hi, I just removed the legal section you readded to the Bobby Cox Article and placed an edited version on the talk page for discuss. I think this info certainly is fair game to include on the page, but it needs to be carefully edited per WP:BLP and some consensus needs to be reached before it is added back. 

 The first sentence alleging a history of spousal abuse is uncited and MUST be removed per WP:BLP. The next few sentences are OK for the most part but they leave off the fact that the charge was later dropped which seems to me to push a POV - so it needs rewriting.  The last sentence doesn't seem to really belong in a article about Bobby Cox and also seems to be POV pushing in my opinion. Perhaps it would be better placed in the MLB article? 

 My thoughts, please discuss on the talk page as it seems like there are several editors that might have good input. Regards."

 ==Your list== 
 Just wanted to let you know, the D`mt period goes from ca. 800 BC to the 5th/4th c. BC, when the proto-Aksumite period starts. The proto-Aksumite period ends ca. 1st c. BC, when the Aksumite period begins. The date of Aksum's shift to the Zagwe dynasty (which you forgot to include in the medieval list, btw, along with the Solomonic dynasty) isn't known yet, but it may actually be the 12th century, since Anbessa Widim, a king remembered by tradition to have been one of the last late Aksumite kings, is now attested to ca. 1125-1150 (we have a colophon in a Bible written by the Patriarch Abba Mika'el in 1150, which notes that Anbessa Widim was king when he was appointed in 1129), so the 937 date you have is much too precise and probably inaccurate. It's based on the assumption that Gudit's reign was the beginning of the Zagwe dynasty and the end of Aksum, which isn't necessarily the case. Anyway, happy editing. —  | (Yom) |  •  • Ethiopia"""

The article is already quite long, and if more sections would be added it would just bog down the readers with too much information. Additionally, make sure you cite frequently. The amount of citations is ok, but it wouldn't hurt to cite more frequently.

 Hello Dennis, I'm not sure if you would read my reply on my 'talk' page, so I;m posting it here as well. Hope this is okay. As you can see, I'm not that Wiki-knowledgeable, apart from article-writing, which is probably why I get into trouble for doing all sorts of things I'm not supposed to ) 

 ::Thanks for your kind words, Dennis.  However, the SPI interested me not at all. I know I'm me, so that's that. No, what has caused me to leave Wikipedia is that I feel I have been bullied, there has also been attempted manipulation and threats of mass deletion of all the articles I created. Is this Wiki policy? I think not. I'm sorry, but I am not prepared to accept that. Life' too short, I don't need it. These were Sudo's parting words to me, relating to the letter above  Considering the attitude you've had with me and several other editors, I'm sorry but I'm not even going to read this.  Treat people like crap and you'll be ignored, because believe it or not, people don't want to be treated like crap, no matter how """"humor'' (there it broke off).

 Having started on Powers """"History As Propaganda"""", could I present my POV on his POV -) 

 First he tries to present himself as an NPOV (aren't we all?), but I get the impression he is quite a strong POV...he is clearly a follower of Tibetan Buddhism having also written """"Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism"""", which is fair enough, but IMHO he has selected his sources, then criticises them (fair enough) and presents a synthesis: balanced eh? 

 But the balance he arrives at, much depends on the choice and presentation of sources, and the weighting given them. In other words Powers has given himself full freedom as to where he will find his balance: and that balance of course just happens to lie inside his comfort space as a believer in TB....  

 As an example: for Powers presents Goldsteins view of the DL as being a """"devious but inept politician"""" who exasperates the Chinese with """"duplicity, intransigence and bungling"""". Now Goldstein thinks the DL made strategic mistakes in his relations with the Chinese, but has a much more qualified view, and never uses that sort of language. So Powers has used the """"straw man"""" technique by presenting a view and language not used by Goldstein, and attacking that to provide evidence of bias.

 Mugging is a type of theft, in which the perpetrator (the mugger) accosts the victim in a public place, such as a sidewalk, street or parking lot, and demands money and/or valuables through the use of force or fear. The thief will typically threaten to use a weapon such as a gun or knife. 

 ==The crime of mugging and its history== 
 The term 'mugging' gained its current popularity in the United States, with New York infamously described in the 1970s as 'the mugging capital of America'. However, the crime is as old as history and among other things has been known as highway robbery, purse-snatching, or footpadding (which could be surreptitious or violent). In Victorian times the targets were wallets and gold watches, but in the US there was a big increase in reported street robberies and handbag snatches from the 1960s onwards as new consumer items became popular. In England the fashion for mugging either arose or gained popularity through many social factors in the late seventies and eighties, and became a cultural phenomenon among some urban youths. In some cultures, there was perceived to be a growing tendency for young males to steal from other young males. The principal targets became valuable and popular accessories like portable audio devices, cameras, laptop computers, mobile phones, and other items that can be quickly and easily resold. Excitement, status, and gang initiation are undoubtedly important motives too. In larger United States cities and in the United Kingdom, the news media report and cover muggings as a crime trend, and some observers blamed the news media for a moral panic in England from the early 1970s at a time when “newspaper reporting of mugging(s) emerged and became increasingly sensational”Hale, D. (1998). Popular Culture, Crime and Justice. Wadsworth Publishing Company, California. Nonetheless, as recorded crime statistics, insurance claims, and national crime surveys all show, street robberies remained a growing problem until they peaked at about the turn of the millennium. 

 Such robberies can involve the threat and/or use of weapons and/or violence.  Most mugging victims are uninjured or suffer minor injuries.  However, in some cases victims die from heart attack or stroke when they struggle with assailants, through falling from moving buses or under vehicles, being knocked to the ground and hitting their heads on the sidewalk, being stabbed with edged weapons or shot with firearms, or beaten with blunt force. More frequently than death, mugging victims sustain lifetime dermatological scarring, facial, cranial, and maxillofacial trauma as well as orthopedic injuries which affect some level of disability, and impact labor and life activities. 

 ==Risk factors for victimization== 
 * Conspicuous display by sidewalk pedestrians of resellable consumer items or indications thereof such as white iPod headphones. 
 * Preoccupation of sidewalk pedestrians by certain activities such as talking on a mobile phone. This activity is seen as a particular risk factor because the victim is distracted by the conversation, typically has compromised hearing and peripheral vision, and is conspicuously displaying a resellable item that can be quickly and easily converted to cash. 

 ==Mugger Modus Operandi== 
 Some muggers operate alone. Others work sidewalks as a group of assailants, that many refer to as a wolf-pack due to the similarities to canine behavior and hunting technique. The wolf-pack technique serves multiple purposes. At the moment of the incident the presence of multiple assailants first deters a solo victim from physically retaliating. Several wolf-pack muggers dressed substantially similar can confuse a victim from making proper suspect identification at a police lineup if the perpetrators are arrested. Following the incident, several wolf-pack muggers dressed substantially similar can also split up stolen merchandise and travel in different directions following their crimes to avoid police identification and arrest. 

 In many United States cities, muggers wear disguises integrated into clothing and accessories, such as hooded sweatshirts or hoodies. Others wear gradient lens glasses or stunner shades as a nighttime fashion accessory. Caps, and hats also serve as a change of disguise. As of 2006 and 2007, ski masks and balaclavas are making a comeback as a popular fashion accessory in some circles. 
 As a basic operations technique, muggers attempt to blend into their surroundings as much as possible to avoid police detection following their crimes. To this extent many wear the local clothing style de-jour. To the extent to which most other persons in their age group wear jeans, the"

The first sentence of the next section says he did his graduate studies in Scotland, and is cited to a pair of books.  The Worldnetdaily article used in our article says the studies in Scotland were interrupted by the return to Kenya - but it could be interrupted after a masters and before a doctorate or it could be before either, impossible to tell.  Frankly, I think if we just clean up the parenthetical comment, the sourcing will become clearer, and the material to my eyes generally satisfies WP:SELFPUB, but I'm not certain it passes the relevance part of the test.  I've reviewed a bunch of our articles on prominent religious leaders, including both those widely respected (the current Pope, Billy Graham) and those best known for scandals (Bakker, Roberts) and none mentioned a degree in the introduction.  Some don't mention degrees at all, some mention them in a subsection about early life or education.  This fits with my general knowledge of the religious field; degrees are not of great importance to a minister.  They may or may not equip him or her for the work, but they are mostly irrelevant to their current and potential congregants.

 == Star Trek canon vs. Star Trek canon == 

 OK, this is getting silly.  It's an incredibly trivial edit to get into an edit war over, so let's be civilized. 

 Here's what the Wikipedia guide to writing better articles has to say about the principle of least astonishment: 

 :===Principle of least astonishment=== 

 :Using the principle of least astonishment, you should plan your pages and links so that everything appears reasonable and makes sense. If a link takes readers to somewhere other than where they thought it would, it should at least take them someplace that makes sense. 

 :====Example==== 

 :A user wants to know about the nuclear power plant that exploded in Chernobyl.  The page on """"Chernobyl"""" redirects to """"Chornobyl"""", an alternative spelling for that town.  However, the user sees that a link to the desired page, Chernobyl accident, is placed prominently near the top of the Chornobyl page, and happily clicks on that. 

 It's true that an editor who saw a link saying Star Trek canon might subsequently type a link as [[''Star Trek'' canon]].  However, such an editor would quickly realize their mistake, just as E. Pluribus Anthony did within two minutes.  It's Wikipedia style to italicize titles of television series, so the link should say Star Trek canon, even though the article is (rightly) at Star Trek canon.

 سوال ۱۰ ۔ کیا اُم المومنین حضرت عائشہؓ کا مولاعلیؑ کے مقابل خروج حق تھا؟ 
 مستند روایات سے پتہ چلتا ہے کہ مولا علیؑ اور حضرت عائشہؓ کے مابین مخاصمت واقعہ افک کے بعد سے ہی شروع ہوگئی تھی جو کہ بڑھتے بڑھتے عداوت اختیار کہ گئی۔ دورانِ واقعہ افک حضوراکرمؐ نے غمغین حالت میں مولا علی ؑ سے مشورہ کیا تو مولا نے آپ کو غم و اضطراب سے بچانے کے لئے یہ مشورہ دیا کہ اللہ تعالیٰ نے آپ پر کچھ تنگی نہیں فرمائی اگر افواہوں کی بنا پر عائشہؓ کی طرف سے کچھ تکرر طبعی ہو گیا ہے تو عورتیں اور بہت ہیں۔ علاوہ ازیں آپ کا یہ تکرار اس طرح بھی رفع ہو سکتا ہے کہ بریرہؓ جو صدیقہ عائشہؓ کی کنیز ہیں۔ اُن سے اُنکے حالات کی تحقیق فرما لیجئے‘‘۔ مولا علیؑ کے اس مشورہ کا حضرت عائشہؓ کو بھی پتہ چل گیا تھا جس کی وجہ سے صدیقہ دِلی طور پر مولا ؑ سے ناخوش تھیں۔ 
 ہادی برحقؐ کی رحلت کے بعد مولا علی ؑ نے چھ ما ہ تک خلیفہ اول سے بیعت نہ کی۔ اِس دوران مسئلہ فدک بھی پیش آیا جس میں حضرت عائشہؓ نے سیدہ فاطمہؓ اور مولا علی ؑ کا بھی ساتھ نہ دیا اور اپنے والد حضرت ابو بکرؓ کی روایت کردہ حدیث کی تصدیق بھی کی۔مجھے مفتی صاحب کی اس بات سے قطعی طور پر اختلاف ہے کہ خلیفہ اول کے دور حکومت میں مولا علیؑ کے گھر کو آگ لگانے کے لئے کھڑیاں اس لئے جمع کی گئیں تھیں کیونکہ گھر میں منافقین اور فسادی جمع ہوگئے تھے۔ 

 سبحان اللہ مفتی صاحب ایک طرف آپ فرما رہے ہیں کہ حضرت عائشہ کے گھر اہل بیت رسولؐ بھی بلا اذن داخل نہیں ہو سکتے تھے دوسری طرف آپ مولا علی ؑ کے گھر میں منافقین جمع ہونے کی خبر دے ر ہے ہیں۔ آپ کا یہ بیان کیا متضاد نہیں؟ کیا مولا کا گھر اہل بیت رسولؐ نہیں تھا؟ اپنی اس غلط بیانی پر ذرا خودی غور فرمائیے۔ نیز جن کو آپ مولا علی کے گھر میں منافقین اور فسادی کہہ رہے ہیں ان میں چند صحابہ کرام مثلاً حضرت عباسؓ بن عبد المطلب، حضرت زبیرؓ ،حضرت طلحہٰ، حضرت مقدارؓ ، حضرت سعد بن ابی وقاص اور خود مولا علیؑ بھی شامل تھے۔ نیز سیدہ فاطمۃ الزھرہؓ و حضرت حسنین ؑ بھی گھر میں موجود تھے ۔ لہٰذہ کیا مولا ؑ کے گھر کو آگ لگانے والے ارباب اختیا ر حضور اکرمؐ کی وصیت بھی بھول چکے تھے جس میں صحابہ کرام ؓ کو تلقین کی گئی تھی کہ میرے شہزادوں کا احترام ، محبت اور تعظیم کرنا۔ 

 ان سب واقعات کے وقوع پذیر ہونے کے باوجود یہ سوال اٹھتا ہے کہ کیا مولا علیؑ اتنے بے بس اور لاچار تھے کہ لوگ ان کے گھر کو آگ لگانے کا پروگرام بنا رہے ہوں اور مولا ؑ خاموش ہیں؟ جواب میں عرض ہے کہ مولاؑ نہ تو خوفزدہ اور نہ ہی لاچار تھے۔ بھلا یہ کیسے ممکن ہے کہ جنگ اخزاب اور جنگ خیبر کا فاتح ایسے موقع پر خوفزدہ ہو۔ اصل بات مولا ؑ کی دور اندیش اور حضور اکرم ؐ کی آخری لمحات میں مولا ؑ کی گود میں وصیت تھی ’’علی میرے بعد تجھے مکر و ہات سے پالا پڑے گا تو دل تنگ نہ کرنا اورصبر کرنا‘‘حضورؐ کی یہ وصیت مولا کے لئے پتھر پر لکیر تھی پھر بھلا صبر کا دامن کیسے چھوڑ دیتے! 
 لکھنے والوں نے تو بہت کچھ لکھا ہے بلکہ لکھوایا گیا ہے۔ لیکن مولا ؑ چونکہ علم دھبی جو اللہ تعالیٰ کی طرف سے حضور اکرمؐ کے توسط سے ودیعت ہوا تھا سے بہتر طور پر سمجھ سکتے تھے کہ مناسب کیا ہے اورکیا نا مناسب ہے ۔ یہی وجہ تھی کہ مولا ؑ نے خلیفہ اول سے خلیفہ ثالث تک پورا پورا تعاون کیا۔ 

 اب ہم آتے ہیں اصل سوال کی طرف کہ کیا اُم المومنین حضرت عائشہؓ کا مولا علیؓ کے مقابل خروج حق پر مبنی تھا؟ 
 اس سوال کا جواب بہت تفصیل طلب ہے۔ مختصراً عرض کردوں کہ ماں جی تمام امھات المومنین سے زیادہ علم رکھتی تھیں۔ آپ نے قرآن پاک کی مندرجہ ذیل آیات بھی یقناًپڑھی ہونگی:۔ 
 ۱:۔ 	 سورۃ الاحزاب (آیت ۶)۔ ترجمہ: نبیؐ مومنوں کے ساتھ خود ان کے نفس سے بھی زیادہ تعلق رکھتے ہیں۔ اور آپؐ کی بی بیاں ان کی ما یں ہیں۔ 
 ۲:۔ 	 سورۃ الاحزاب (آیت ۳۱-۳۲)۔ ترجمہ: 	  ۳۱  اے نبی کی بی بیو تم معمولی عورتوں کی طرح نہیں اگر تم تقویٰ اختیار کرو۔ ۳۲: اور تم اپنے گھروں میں قرار سے رہو۔ 
 مذکورہ بالا احکام کی روشنی میں ممکن ہے حضرت عائشہؓ نے صحابہ کو تلقین کی ہو لیکن زیادہ احتمال یہی ہے کہ دیرنہ عدوات جو کہ انسانی فطرت ہے اورمشیروں کے غلط مشوروں سے خروج ہوا۔ ماں جی کو یقین تھا کہ مولا ؑ قاتلانِ عثمان میں شامل نہیں ہیں بلکہ مولا علیؑ نے آخری دم تک ؟؟؟؟ اپنے شہزادوں کے حضرت عثمانؓ کا ساتھ دیا۔ حضرت عائشہؓ ایک عالمہ فا ضلہ ام المومنین تھیں ایک عرصہ حضور اکرمؐ کر قربت میں گزارہ تھا اور اس پر فخر بھی کیا کرتی تھیں۔ 
 آپکے علم میں یہ دو حدیثیں تو ضرور ہونگی جن کا مفہوم یہ ہے:۔ 
 ۱: اے علی میرے بعد تمہارے ساتھ یہ اُمت دعا کرے گی تم میری ملت پر زندہ رہو گے۔ (کنز العمال علی متقی الجز سادس ۱۰۷۲) 
 ۲: 	 اے عائشہؓ میرے بعد تم ایک گروہ کی قیادت کرو گی جو نا حق ہو گا۔ مقام خواب پر تمہاری اونٹنی پر کتے بھونکیں گے۔ 
 ۳: 	 حضرت عمار بن یاسر کو ایک باغی گروہ قتل کرے گا۔ 
 اتنی واضح احادیث ہوتے ہوئے بھی مولا علیؑ کے خلاف خروج چہ معنی دارد۔ پھر مولاؑ بھی وہ جن کی شان شیخ سعدیؒ نے فرمایا۔ 
 بعدازمصطفےٰ در کل عالم 	  نہ بُد فاضل ترو بہتر ز حیدر ؑ 
 بہر حال ماں جی نے خروج جن حالات اورجس وجہ سے کیا ظاہری تو ایک فطری عداوت ہی لگتی ہے۔ ورنہ مائیں تو اولاد کو صُلح و امن کا ہی مشورہ دیتی ہیں البتہ انکے خروج سے نہ صرف جنگ جمل ظہور پذیر ہوئی بلکہ جنگِ صفین، واقعہ حُرہ، سانحہٰ کربلا اور نہ جانے کتنے فتنے برپا ہوئے اور ہوتے رہیں گے۔یقیناً ماں جی کو اس حدیث مبارکہ کا بھی علم ہوگا جس میں حضور اکرمؐ نے فرمایا ’’عنقریب میرے اہل بیت میرے بعد میری اُمت سے قتل و غارت دیکھیں گے اور ہمارے سب سے زیادہ بغض رکھنے والے دشمن بنو اُمیہ، بنو المغیرہ و بنو مخدوم ہونگے (حدیث صحیح بخاری باب الفتن نمبر ۷)۔ ‘‘

 To reply on what Frank Close actually says: 

 ;Extracts from Chapter 9, The Infinity Puzzle, 2013. Relevant snips underlined, rest is to add context 
 * Although several people discovered the mechanism whereby vector gauge bosons can acquire mass, Brout and Englert being the first to publish a relativistic demonstration, only Higgs drew attention to the consequential existence of a massive scalar particle, which now bears his name. 

 * By the late summer of 1964 they [Guralnik and Hagen] had """"pretty much everything but still had concerns over some fine details."""" His former mentor Walter Gilbert was lecturing at a summer school at Lake Como, so Guralnik made a special trip to tell him what they had achieved.... At the very time when Guralnik was talking with Gilbert, Higgs’s paper was already in production. This would become apparent only later... 

 * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were """"three papers, one by Robert Brout and François Englert... and two by Peter Higgs."""" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  

 * Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble’s work was tightly argued and contained unique insights toward understanding the depth of these new ideas. However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... 

 * Gerald Guralnik was one of those who approached the finishing line early but failed to publish fast enough. 

 * In another of the coincidences in this tale, the editor of PRL received Higgs’s manuscript on the very same day that Brout and Englert’s paper was published. When Higgs’s paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: """"He couldn’t have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?"""" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and """"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work."""" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgs’s name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstone’s massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstone’s other boson—the massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. 

 * So it was that Brout, Englert, and Higgs had all published papers, while GHK were writing their own paper, ignorant of developments due to the British postal strike until the fateful moment when Kibble announced the news. 

 * Tom Kibble recalled: """"As a matter of fact [in 1964] the Higgs Boson was not seen by anyone as a particularly important feature. The interest [then] was in the way the gauge vector bosons acquired a mass, eating up the Goldstone [massless] Boson on the way. Now of course it’s important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory."""" ... Kibble’s perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, """"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated. We didn’t know about Glashow’s work [on the SU2 × U1 model of the weak and electromagnetic forces] at all."""" 

 * During the International Conference on High Energy Physics at Berkeley in 1966, Ben Lee prominently referred to the “Higgs Boson” and the “Higgs Mechanism.” ... As the GHK team, including Hagen, had not completed their paper until after the appearance of Higgs’s original papers, and as Higgs had built on this further during 1966, with a study of how"

Imagine that! A section called """"genocide"""" Why the heck do you not have a stronger emphasis like that on the WORLD WAR 2 page, where they were murdering people on an industrial scale! The issue here is more than a paragraph about the Poles or the Soviets… it is that you  as a """"moderator"""" make every effort possible to water down the brutal truth behind the WWII conflict. In fact, I still would like you to comment on my reply regarding the German Election issue, where I challenge your misinformed statement about the nature of the German electorate, and their support for Hitler. The WWII article needs to highlight the following point: 

 ::::::*German Elections of 1932, where Hitler received substantial support (if not a complete majority) from the German voters 
 ::::::*Renaming the """"Concentration camps and slave work"""" section to """"The Holocaust, concentration camps and slave labor"""" 
 ::::::*Include a short paragraph about the German SS atrocities in Poland, and USSR; including examples of specific operations  

 ::::::I do not think that those requests will somehow alter the neutrality of the article as these events happened; and they happened on a massive scale. For example the German SS had over a 1,200,00 paramilitary troops, and their impact on the conduct of the war can not be understated.

 ==A few section changes== 

 When I was reading through the article, the contents of """"Historical view and usage"""" threw me for a loop because most of the section discussed the nature/ontology of the Trinity in the modern (unqualified) sense. The bit on history seemed like a good lead in, so I changed the second level heading to """"Ontology of the Trinity"""" and made """"Historical view and usage"""" the first subsection. 

 The bit on """"Christian Life and the Blessed Trinity"""" also seemed out of place as that section discusses the implications or application of the concept of Trinity, and not the nature of Trinity itself. So, I moved that to be a second level section after the section on dissent, figuring that it would read best as """"point/counterpoint"""" and then onto a new subject. 

 Speaking of sections, it seems that the """"Historical view and usage"""" section should be merged with the """"Historical development"""" section. I thought I'd leave this change to the more involved authors, though.

 Bruno Angelico (born in Paris France) is a professional performer well known as the creator of an extreme and acrobatic sport based on the concept of the gymnastic """"Traveling rings.""""  
 * A specialized physical discipline of training which he calls “Drifting.” 
 * His performances have been featured in many commercials such as Nike, LA Inc, Direct TV etc. Also seen on the internet or on TV with Discovery Channel. 
 * He is also photographed and featured in newspapers such as the New York Times and Los Angeles Times Magazine. 
 * He has trained to this discipline with different techniques he developed stuntmen, traceurs, personal trainers and performers from various circuses including Cirque du Soleil. 
 * At today’s date he is still the only one in the world to be able to perform some very difficult stunts on the traveling rings. 
 * He is also a stuntman, a race-car driver, an actor and a musician who recently created a Funk/Soul band called """"Baby Funk & The Children of Truth"""". 
 He performed as an actor and a stuntman in major film productions such as LA Confidential as a Guest-Star with actors like Kiefer Sutherland, Tom Cruise, Geoffrey Rush, Jewel and many more. 
 He was also seen with Enrique Iglesisas in the Wild Wild West """"Bailamos"""" production or TV shows such As """"Sliders""""  

 ==== * Traveling rings: ==== 
 * They are part of a structure of 75 feet long by 16 feet wide and 16 feet High. 10 rings are suspended about 8 feet off the ground and 8 feet apart. 
 * The basic goal was to swing from one ring to another and come back to the starting point. The first structure of this size was standing at the """"Original Muscle Beach"""" of Santa Monica California in the US. It was built and designed by stuntman Russ M Saunders in 1963. And then demolished in 1998. 2 were rebuilt in Feb 2000. 
 * Bruno Angelico seriously started to focus on this discipline in 2000 with the rebuilt structure. 
 * He is known to have created a multitude of stunts that he performs with ease, grace and style. 
 * Bruno Angelico was the first one to incorporate the structure (which was taboo then) in his wild and acrobatic expression.  
 * He was known to be the first one to bounce off the poles or going around the poles or changing grips between poles in a middle of a routine. 
 * He was also the first one to skip a multitude of rings in a full swing. 
 * He was also the first one to create “Mid air stunts” in the middle of a routine meaning letting go of all rings skipping rings with the same hand. He could also perform flips in mid air catching another ring in the middle of his swing. 
 * Not only he swings from one ring to another by his knees, he is also known to be the first one to be able to go from one ring to another by his feet and toes completely barefoot. He can also skip rings by his feet with a small grip apparatus attached to his ankle. 
 * What Bruno Angelico created and developed could be assimilated to a form of Parkour on the gymnastic rings.

 The Wikipedia article should start with a plain citation of the first amendment before launching into a breakdown of its components or any explanation of the amendment. 

 The article should start by saying:  

 The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States is,  

 """"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."""" 

 Citation: The Constitution of The United States 

 Not doing so fails to allow the reader to interpret and judge the discussion in full knowledge of the amendment itself. I can see no good reason for creating such a situation, and can easily see how it opens the door to those who wish to persuade the reader to adopt a particular interpretation, lacking reference to the amendment itself.

For another thing, the text draws POV conclusions instead of just giving info about what the document says.  For a third thing, it puts this under a heading that totally loses the context of what Rusk was writing.  I'll try to rewrite in a more reasonable and less polemic way.

 == IRAN == 
 That’s right, Iran. It was our drone. And it was spreading homosexual Western ideas over Iran. We call it the bone-drone. Get used to it, you fabulous bearded Mullahs! 
 Let me just say that the wording used for the recent """"Iran incident"""" was misleading at best. Most people do not know that International airspace starts 12 nautical miles off the coast... so saying that the incident SUPPOSEDLY (we should definitely keep the supposedly, unless you believe what professional liars and spin doctors feed you like it's the word of Dog - which wouldn't surprise me considering the MASSIVE INFLUX OF RIGHT WING SCUM, SHILLS AND PROVOCATEURS WHO'VE INVADED WIKIPEDIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS AND TURNED IT INTO A CESSPOOL) happened 16 miles from Iran does not make sense. It makes more sense to tell the god damned mother fucking truth and say that it SUPPOSEDLY occurred FOUR (4) miles from Iranian air space....while we (the USA) were SUPPOSEDLY using an expensive to operate piece of military equipment to do surveillance and recon over OPEN OCEAN WATERS... because the navy is into bird watching and flora fauna type shit... especially so close where Iran has extensive military and industrial facilities... because our leaders HAVEN'T totally admitted that we violate Iran's airspace all the time and will continue to do so despite the loss of the drone they SUPPOSEDLY hacked or whatever happened to it.    

  
 Hello there Mr. """"Semi-Retired"""" ... The biased, rash, inflammatory, speculative, antagonistic and sensationalist (3) article which are cited actually do back up the modifications I made. The incident occurred SUPPOSEDLY 4 miles from Iran's air space, not 16.

 've been reading this talk page and I was amazed by the way some people are ready to make such a violent debate about issues they seem not to know the basis of what they're talking about. I may understand that some of the contributors to this discussion do not know a world of arabic, but that is a shame when discussing the work of someone (antoun saadeh) who wrote mainly in arabic (his complete works is a 17 volume series of around 200 page each, and cover a nearly 30 years of writing) and a party whose intellectuals (at least 4 generations) have a massive production of memoires, and doctrinal discussions (to name a few concerning memoirs Abdallah koberssi, Jebran Jreij,Julia el mir-saadeh, Ibrahim yamout, Mahmoud Nehme... for doctrinal discussions Said Taki el dinne, Wassim zeineddine, Nassif Nassar, Enaam Raed, Aboud Aboud...). I think some due clarifications are to be made: 1- concerning racism and Nazi claims: a) back in 1934, when he was in french mandate jails and when the Reich was at his peak and eugenism was still in vogue in Europe and America, Saadeh wrote one of the most central books in his doctrine """"The Rise of Nations"""", in the second chapter of the book he makes - based on a well referenced scientific anthropological findings and other writings regarding the development of national identity in Europe - a solid case against races' superiority claim (he clearly defines social interaction between different people of different origin and culture as basis to any real development in human history) and underline that linking nationalism to racism (in taking examples not only of Germany but also of France and Europe in early 18th century) is a very reactionary and dangerous position, that should be combatted in the Arab Levant a land of strong diversity. b) On the other hand it is well known - and referenced, even Pipes and Hitchens would agree so - that SSNP followers are form very different religious (of very diverse sects) and ethnic (arabs, but also kurds, armenians, greeks, turks, persians, franks...) origins. And they might be with some communist parties in the region the very few who could proclaim such a diversity, Hardly a case for racism c) concerning the alleged saadeh's anti-arabs positions. It is striking thow some get to such a conclusion, when one of the 4 core objectives of the party clearly stated in its Goal, is the cration of a pan-arab front. saadeh defended what he called """"true arabism"""", in his view a realistic, operative version of arabism capable of mobilizing development and resistance to colonial and then Zionist threts. He attacked conventional arabism (claiming a one Nation from Mauritania to the comores ilands, and mainly based on the sole lingual link, and the arab islamic culture negating all minority cultures). That does not mean that Saadeh's position is an anti-arab cultural position but that of considering the arab golden era of the middle ages as part of a longer history going from antiquity to present days, building a certain """"geographic culture"""" in a certain geographic territory that is in his view the Fertile Crescent. He sees his Greater Syria and his party as one of the forces in the rise of the Arab World. c) most importantly his social nationalism doctrine is contradictory to any racism or even any chauvinism - that he denounces plainly in his writings. His conception of nationalism has at its core two central founding dynamics """"social interaction"""" and """"territorial interaction"""". The """"Moutahhad"""" is his elementary social and territorial unit, it is considered to be the territorial scale in which basic needs (mainly security, food, shelter and community) could be achieved via social interaction. there is different level of Moutahads incorporating linked nets of smaller Moutahds, and responding to different level of human needs ( As a exemple a village or a town quarter is an elementery Moutahad, a territorial region or a metropolis is a different level of Moutahad incorporating a network of villages or of quarters...). The """"Watan"""" or """"Patrie"""" is the Nation level territorial Moutahad. For Saadeh beeing part of a Moutahad is a simple choice to live in it, and committing ones future to its, regardless of racial, cultural or religious origin. Of course left by itself and ruled by reactionary exclusive cultures set on primary social bodies (clans, tribes, large families, religious groups...), such a space holding great potentials for development will turn out to be a battlefield of tribes and flags, and a backyard for colonial exploitation. That's where he think his Nahda, a Cultural and Political Renaissance is needed to bring in a more liberal modernist spirit - in opposition to the racist Toranic movement of Ataturk or the Fascist approach of Mussolini, he thought to do it not by deneing the multicultural status of the Levant and consider rich with heritage, and by proving in his writings, that none of these cultures are fundamentally racis"
