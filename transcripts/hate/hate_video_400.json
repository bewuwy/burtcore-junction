What happened was this email got bounced back to me. They bounced. They bounced the email back and then I figured oh okay something wrong with two to no. So I used my other email today sent an inquiry to them. Oh that one's banned too. The email associated with my banned account. So both the emails from my current account and my banned account are both shadow banned by this alleged unauthentic email things. That's just their way to put me on a list. Oh we'll put him on unauthenticated. I figured it was just because of that. They weren't just accepting from two to no. Oh they're not accepting from my other email address from a different provider as well. So that's not true of some shady shit here. I don't know what it is man. I tried to send an email to support and I'm banned from even talking to BitChute support. So what does that tell you about the transparency? Yeah this is your song BitChute shady kites. No transparency. A lot of stuff happening in the shadows with no notification, no accountability, no nothing. That kike in the background, whoever that dude is, that's with Vahee. You never see, never hear about him. Let me just hear there's another guy out there. Massad IDF, whatever. Fucking piece of shit. Fuck you, you kikes. We're coming for you. Shady kikes. Gonna free BitChute of you shady kikes. Gonna take it over. Fuckers. You won't win.",
