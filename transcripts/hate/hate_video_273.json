  "text": " The other day I took a fishing trip Just me and my boat, an old banjo lily, banjo was my guide An old colored fella He wasn't very dark, he was a high-stepping yellow So he lost my boat And I cranked my motor, up to my nose, came my terrible odor I looked all around, trying to find something dead But it was banjo with his arm up, scratching his head Some nigger never died, they just smelled that way And the more he scratched, the more he'd sweat And I'm here to say he was a choking mid-a-damp So we loaded up, I just couldn't go on And I coughed and I gag, all the way home When I dropped him on, I was next to die My nose was a running And my eyes were crying The smells gorge the hair right out of my nose When I got home, I had to burn all my clothes Some niggers never died, they just smelled that way I recuperated quick, I was thankful for that I was only in bed for a week and a half The very first day I was up on my feet I went to the supermarket down the street I shopped all around and I filled out my order My groceries were bagged by a fat nigger porter The air conditioner was broken I was perotious because it was hot and then nigger was a sweatin' on my groceries Some niggers never died, they just smelled that way The vegetables and greens I both started wielding My blood pressure rose and I could have killed it I was gonna smash him all over that place But he raised up his arm and I fell on my face And I'm here in the hospital at the scene and I stare I could have whipped that nigger, simply used your warm bath So from now on I carry a long, long stick As if I can keep from the smell And I'll have him with it Some niggers never died, they just smelled that way",
