  "text": " and they're and and they continue to fucking do this shit from YouTube. I say, well, fuck you. I'm gonna I'm gonna retaliate against you. I'll escalate this fucking conflict until you don't want to fuck with me anymore. And yeah, I Contacted all I said you want to go fucking fuck some assholes over and rather than take the information from me, he published my email to Twitter and then Immediately after that angry white man published something that was the result of a month's long and fucking investigation and they lost some shit and I'm fucking glad because they suck and they don't deserve a platform. Now let me let me ask you a couple things now first off, hold you didn't preface your email with you know, look, it's Jared hold. I'm not gonna say he necessarily what are respected that anyway, but you didn't say, you know, off the can we talk off the record or this and that. So I guess by by the official journalistic code, he's he's can actually share that, you know, I mean, did you think about doing that or I don't give a fuck like the thing is that if I had given him the information, I'd have told everybody that I Game the information. This was not something that I was trying to do serotoniously, right? So like every time that I've talked to the federal government, every time I've Talked to the media, I tell everybody exactly what I've done, right? So like, you know, my whole fucking the reason that people have all this fucking, you know, people take things out of Fucking context, but like the reason people have so much out of context shit to say about me is because I feel obligated to like inform people of What I'm doing when I when I engage in these things, okay? And so I didn't you know, I hadn't given whole to any information, so I didn't feel like I needed to say Anything yet, but like if I had done this I'd have taken credit for it. I'd be like, yeah, I got you de platform do not fuck with me as whole. That's exactly what I Would have said. So like I didn't really care. It was suboptimal that he published it the way he did. You know, I would have preferred things to go differently, but you know, so like I think that the fucking left wing media is gonna adhere to a fucking standard of decency anyway. But you're lying to your pricks. Now let me ask you can you see why some people might see this and like be upset with with what you did here. I would expect them to be upset. I'm trying to fuck them over. That's the whole entire point. Now, but I mean, just other people as well like I mean, you're it's kind of funny the way you put it out. I'll read it again. I've got some an internet scene conflicts, which would best be solved by my competitors getting the platform that I laugh when I read it because it's just flat out take them off the air. That's exactly what I'm trying to do, right? So like they use look these guys are on YouTube. They're violating the terms of service, right? And so like they and like they had me on they had me on Goy talk to go and respond to these defamation that they were giving fucking voice to, right? But the thing is that since they're violating the terms of service, what they do is they delete the streams afterwards. There's not an archive. They take their super chats and they take the fucking money and run, right? So they have me on to respond to the defamation, but then the next day they're out there airing the defamation again. Well, I'm not going to go on your fucking channel every day and respond to this every time obviously, right? So like something has to be done in order to stop these fucking assholes from defaming my character. Okay, that's a league. If in the F no state fucking character defamation is legally actionable. Okay. And so the fucking so since I can't punch these fucking faggots in their faces, I find other ways to fucking make their lives difficult. And if I can fucking feed them to the Jews, then I will.",
