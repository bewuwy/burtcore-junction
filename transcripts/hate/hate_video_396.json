Like I told myself I'm gonna put it right here and here it is. It's right here now. I know where it is. Then I don't know what the fuck happens. I smoke a bowl like turn around and it's gone. It falls into the fucking black hole again. God damn my swear I hit my fucking life. The day I snap and take out a bunch of people it's gonna start off like this. I'm gonna be sitting down looking for my remote and then just gonna fucking snap and can't take it anymore. Now I'm stuck watching Larry King. I'm stuck watching Filthy ass Jewish Larry King make a filthy Jew of himself. I'm so sick of these fucking greedy bastards. Let me tell you Larry King has millions and millions of dollars. He was probably making 15 million a year his last 15 years on CNN. He's in his 80s. He set for life. There's no reason why he needs to do something underhanded for money. So he spends all this time on CNN building journalistic credibility with the elderly. Now what he's doing is infomercials and he's making these infomercials look like legitimate news interviews. So he brings on someone and the person starts talking about his company and all the specials that they're having. It's made to fool old people into thinking that this is news and that this is a company that's somehow been verified by CNN or legitimate news. And it's just bullshit infomercial that's paid Larry King's Jewish ass to sit there and sell his fucking soul to make a few extra shillings that will never fucking spend. This is why motherfuckers bitch about the Jews because their greed is unquenchable. Their greed is beyond their life. Their greed is beyond life. It's beyond humanity. It's unfuckin' real. They're greed. I need to calm the fuck down and smoke a bowl and take one of those funny pills that my doctor gave me that makes me not want to hurt people supposedly. Please subscribe to my channel. Help me out. My name is Taz Bitter. You've been listening to my shit. Fucking bullshit.",
