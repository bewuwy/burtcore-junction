  "text": " Hey guys, what's up? So I am here stuck at the chas because I gave away my last $20 of my parents' spend going to me to two black people as per the request of our leaders. So I figured, you know, a good way to start making a little bit of money so I can eat and drink water because I'm not allowed to touch any of the black people stuff. I thought, you know, I could just start a chasercise class. I want a great idea, right? So we're just going to start out with a few little moves. I'm going to show you how they go. So our first move we're going to be doing is we're going to take a knee and then we're going to throw out the commie fist. So let's do it. One, two, three, take a knee, commie fist, take a knee, commie fist, two more, take a knee, commie fist and take a knee, commie fist, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. So the next one, we're going to be working shoulder mobility. So we are going to take our hand, we're going to reach back for our wallets. We're going to take them out and we're going to hand them to black people. Okay, other side, take out your wallets, hand them to the black people. Good job, everybody. Okay. So this one, we're going to be working the core. The core is very important, especially when you're running from the popo. So we're going to put our hands up like this and every time we see a non-white walking body, we're going to bow down. We're going to bow down if you want to increase the intensity a little bit. You can even throw up a knee. That's your value down. Just don't bow down to any white person, okay? Or your surprise is not safe. Okay, anyways, we're going to move on now. Our next move is punch a Nazi. So you can either punch a Nazi in real life, or you can just shadow box, you know, just pretend there's a Nazi there and, you know, stop a stop what's up guys, you know, it's tracks. Okay, our last move is going to be the invisible backpack. Now, many of you probably don't know what I'm talking about, but it is your invisible backpack of life privilege. You were carrying around with you everywhere you go. Nobody can see it. Nobody knows what's in it, what it's made up of. So we're just going to put that invisible backpack on which you have. Don't question me. And we're going to do some squats with all of that white privilege on your back that's just weighing you down. Just get rid of it. Give away your privilege, give away your money, give away your life. So I hope everybody enjoyed my chasercise class if you want to donate. You're correct. What's you doing? Just doing a chasercise class to tie around. Just try to, you know, earn a little money side of the evening. Chas, we don't call chas no more. It's called chop. Like chopping off the heads of white supremacists. Oh yeah, that's so cool. Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's add one more move, right? Why not? So this one is going to be called the chop. You're going to go down, I'm going to chop, chop off the white people's heads and white supremacy. Well, thank you so much everybody for decolonizing fitness with me today. And I hope you give me some money so I can get out of here and not die. Okay, bye. Thanks guys. Black Lives Matter.",
