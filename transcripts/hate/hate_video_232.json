Let's take a vacation in South Carolina and finally. Take me to church. I remember when it all started. My buddy Dylan joking about Bible studies. This bull cut hair due bagged was pretty funny, but his thoughts were kind of muddy. They were twisted, but in a good way, like me, think of blasting the blacks. I can still hear him laughing now, me saying well, people asking how he could do it, put 9 people, under, put him to slumber, take them to God, while I say what God. Because my boy, the Charleston chimp choking champion had the right thing in mind to attack the church, from the inside, and corrupt the minds of the fucking bagged niggers in that church, so what I have to say is, take me to church. I have to confess my sins. I have to search for something to let me and the number 9 is coming to my mind. 9 people, 9 niggers, 9 Christians. Let's take a vacation in South Carolina and finally. Take me to church. You may say he's evil, you may say niggers are equal, you may say that the shit, that is spewed under that stupid shit steeply is true, but you are wrong, you're all wrong. So, so long, next time you think you are safe when you're in church, just remember Dylan, and me, and I'm free, as you seek so unlucky, to a better life, shoot up your wife, and kill your kids, kill the niggers at a church. Without me? What the fuck? It's just me, Dylan. Faggot I know, but you scared the shit out of me. Sorry, man. How the fuck did you ask him? I just fucking ran. They gave me a fucking bulletproof vest, so I ran. I stole a car and killed a couple niggers on the way. Shit man, ready for this? Take me to church. I have to confess my sins, I have to search, for something to let me in. The number 9 is coming to my mind. 9 people, 9 niggers, 9 Christians. Let's take a vacation in South Carolina and finally. Take me to church. I was waiting for the moment for oh so long, what I did was not even wrong. Me and Moonman were always together on this. This gets me pissed. Those damn pigs took me in, took me for a spin. They said I sinned. They said I'm going to hell, but how could I go to a place that doesn't exist? Mother fuckers, and I love killing those spur-chuckers, those dirty niggers. Cotton picker, filthy fucking niggers. You said it man. We are in another clan, un-one, a CCC. The church shopping crew, we are new all for you. Out to kill all you Christians, but don't forget, we are in the KKK, so we will kill the niggers too. Take me to church. I have to confess my sins, I have to search, for something to let me in. The number 9 is coming to my mind. 9 people, 9 niggers, 9 Christians. Let's take a vacation in South Carolina and finally. Take me to church.",
