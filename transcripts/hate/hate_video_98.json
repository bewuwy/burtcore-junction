  "text": " What, uh, well, getting back into the subject of summer and summer stuff, here's something I was thinking about. Of course, you'll know about summer camps. You may have gone to a summer camp when you were a kid. However, I mean, most niggas don't go to summer camps like think because, uh, you know, their parents would rather spend the money on crack and KFC. But, if we had summer camps exclusively for nigglets, for example, let me say they'd be like, I mean, because I mean, in these in these PC times, they got a tailor everything to each group. So I think it'd be fair to have summer camps just for nigglets. So what would these camps be like? I think it would be like trying to get them in touch with their African roots. There would be an open pitlite train with flies flying around there. And right next to the pitlite train will be like a water ditch. So they can get to the water. At the same place they get there and they take a shit. So that would be, they'd be sleeping on the floor in the dirt. The housing quarters would be made out of mud and straw, of course. But they would have a killer sound system so they can listen to their rap music, just being America and everything. I got to have their rap music. And let's see, the camp counselors are all pedophiles. Well, here's what I think, uh, I like a nigglet summer camp would be like, um, excuse me, you know, you start early in the morning and by early in the morning, for niggers, I mean like one p.m. You know, you get up, you know, you have a good breakfast of chidlands and, you know, thighs from Popeyes. And maybe a small glass of king cobra because it's early in the day. You don't want it to get all wasted. So a small glass of more lich, then you, then you have your first activity of the day, about two o'clock. You have a Genkin workshop. You know, you have all the nigglets take it down to a to a bottle. And, uh, you know, you stay to bottle, seal them up, bury them, you know, I don't know forrest and, you know, you start making some jank them. You know, it's like a, like an arts and crafts sort of thing to give the nigglets some busy work. Then maybe, uh, about this, say four o'clock ish, taking them out to the lake, for an attempted swim. And I mean, the tactic is nigglets and water, you know, don't make a big noise. So you probably lose about third of the nigglets there from drowning. And, uh, then, uh, for a couple of hours to then, about six o'clock, it'll be time for, well, for us, he must be to be time for dinner for nigglets. It'll be about time for lunch. So I don't know, guess if barbecue sandwiches or whatever, uh, some grape drink. And then, uh, for that's done, so about eight o'clock, you know, maybe, uh, you can have a movie, it can be movie night, you can have him watch some classics, like, you know, boys in the hood or how high or, uh, Friday. Yeah, Friday, next Friday, you know, do, maybe do a whole night of watching the, you know, Friday and the sequels. Or maybe have a nice, cute movie night. Uh, and then, to top it off, about 10 o'clock once it's dark, you know, do like campfire, you know, in a normal summer camp, you have a campfire, you have the kids sitting around to keep the fire and sing some songs. So I mean, instead of singing, say, bingo or she'll be coming around to mountain, they can sing, you know, some old two-puck, chicore classics or sing, uh, sing, fuck the police. Yeah, misspeaches or sing some, uh, notorious B.I.G. tunes, you know, good campfire music. And then about, uh, one in the morning, just give the kids some crack, you know, get them ready for bed. And, uh, and that's a day right there. Perfect, Nigger Summer Camp. That's a good day. You got any ideas to add to the Nigger Summer Campfire experience flag medal? Well, I would think that you will get more of your disadvantaged youths as, uh, the liberals would call it. So you'd have to have them there some, um, marksmanship training, uh, with AK-47s. You know, they got to make sure they got the right stance, leg spread, holding it sideways, a good old-fashioned spray and prey. Hope that they, you know, can at least hit some of the bystanders. Uh, another good one would be, uh, I don't know if this would be arts and crafts or, I don't know, it would be graffiti, but they would have to take, uh, some purple drink as it's called, uh, a bottle of, uh, robotoson, what have you, see how high they can get and see what kind of graffiti they can make on the walls of their mudhuts. How about a rape class? You know, I don't know, my sense of bad idea because Nigger's know how to rape from birth. It kind of comes natural. So, I hate to shoot you down like that, but that's true. I think he's on the something. See what they need to do is teach them how to, uh, get used to Mace, uh, the quickest way of, uh, pinning down a person and raping whatever orifice or, you know, just behind the knees or armpit, whatever they can get to, as fast as they can. That's what they need to know this kind of stuff. I wonder if there's just so much something they can do, they can make like, uh, make a, say, make a portrait of, uh, 50 cents out of macaroni, uh, you know, or, uh, you know, uh, make a, uh, like a picture of a housing project out of construction paper. I mean, there's so much Nigger's could do at a good Nigger summer camp, you know, and, and, and the counselors, of course, would be, you know, typical Nigger drug addicts and, uh, welfare recipients and, you know, whether it has scumbia can round up and any perfect role models for the Nigglets, uh, because they would teach him basically what their future would be like. Well, the campfire, the campfire actually, they wouldn't be using wood, they would be using typical Nigger fair like, uh, use tires, radiator hoses, uh, gasoline, uh, you know, blocks, because, yeah. I think they'd, uh, drag up some of the, uh, drown Nigglets too. That could be some good fire right there. Hey, just a roll around on the spit, you know, put an apple in his mouth. Well, you might as well have a take roast out there, you know. Uh, I mean, God, I mean, I, I don't know who would eat that, but still. And, uh, well, I mean, there's, how the there are timidest, I guess, they could go canoeing, I'll feel like, I wonder how to believe Nigger's wouldn't go out into water like that. Uh, God, what else? I guess they're sports. I can get in place on, uh, basketball. Yeah, he took it to work out of my mouth. Uh, you know, some back of ball and they can, they can learn how to do their slam dung and, um, maybe, uh, well, no, practice some football and, and some dances. Well, there's an idea. I will first summer camp if they have a summer camp for girls, you know, they got to give a proper Nigger parenting classes to the six, seven-year-old, uh, Niglet Sal, to prepare them for eventually when they become pregnant at nine. And, uh, it's really quite wide open. Well, I am dead. I mean, actually, to make it fun, I think I'm given a ward to whoever gets pregnant first before the camp is over. And the winner is the winner is Shiniikwa. She got pregnant ten minutes. They should also teach them how to fill out their welfare, uh, forms properly. That is, uh, some good advance now and dance knowledge for the Nigger. The two soon will be living off the system. Of course. What are you going to take into skills? And that skills, especially with a Z, like Zebra at the end, the skills will need it to get by in a real world. How to fill out welfare forms. You know, how to, uh, I don't know, you know, how to get whatever to kind of like government, how to get a section A department, how to get food stamps, you know, what you can buy with which food stamp are what you can't, and, uh, you know, basically how to, how to lie about your means so you can get more welfare. You know, how much of money you got to pernigulate that you get birth to. Denying fraternity. Of course. You know, how to sign up for the Mori show. Basic needs that young Niggers, uh, need to get by in life. Yeah. So these Niggers summer can be a very positive thing, I think, for our African-American youth, where you can, like, and they can learn some skills that will serve them well in their life as useless, worthless, scummy-ass burdens on society. So I think Obongo should provide some federal funding for this stuff. Yeah, Nigger summer camps. That would be perfect. I mean, you could humans could have their summer camps and, you know, the Nigglets could have their summer, and it would be culturally, culturally relevant as well. Well, actually, truth be told, if it was up to me, this is what my idea of a, uh, Nigger summer camp would be like. You take, you take a big, uh, space shuttle before it gets to be, uh, a really science-based show to be able to fit, uh, you know, at least a few thousand Niggers. So it had to be sort of like a, sort of like a slave spaceship basically. You could feel a lot of Niggers in a relatively small space. Shoot them off into space. The end. That's summer camp. Let the vacuum of space take care of me. Yeah, that'll be their camp. Basically, exploding and exploding in the vacuum of space. How about that? I think we forgot one thing, too. Uh, this",
