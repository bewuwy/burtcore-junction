  "text": " Afternoon folks, how is everybody? I was just listening to Tim Poole and I have to laugh my ass off. So I'm going to assume that if you're watching this channel you have some idea with Poole Lewis. But the... Give you a little backstory. Tim Poole six months ago was so anti-gun, super lefty, whatever. And I said back then he's just playing it. He's just doing it as a marketing ratings thing. Nobody can be that stupid. Gotta stop saying that. But uh... he'd go on, he'd do his stick and do his stories and then he contradict himself and I'd be like... While back I did a video about people who will only go to the edge of the box but never look over the edge and Tim was the perfect example. All the evidence would be there right up against the cardboard and you want to look over the edge. It's too scary to look over the top of the box. Peace all that information together so you know what's really going on in the world. The Boogelloo boys. So apparently the left is terrified of these horrible Boogelloo people who want to take over the government and they're all horrible white extremists and primists and all this other bullshit and I'm listening to this and I'm fucking laughing. So just you understand and they're all terrified of civil war. Just you understand. I understand the whole Boogelloo movement and I'm not one of the... The Boogelloo movement would be something more akin to patriots, people who are sick and tired of the crap going on in their country. They will most likely be center right to right but not super far right. These people would be more likely to know the Constitution backwards and forwards than a politician. But they're sick and tired of thermoclimate today. It's killer man. From Wendy Aldeva. But... Three percenters are the thing and the concept of three percenters and only took three percent of the population to overthrow the British and get them out of the country. Three percent. Tea partyers. These guys are the next evolutionary extension except for the fact that they are just people from share the same opinion. It's not Antifa. It's not the clan. These are just Americans who want America to go back to being America without a K. Now to stay what I'm saying here. These are just people who are sick and tired of watching their country devolve. Every special interest group gets points over the guy who goes to work every day. Black Lives Matter is now a super thing and more on to busy apologizing for shit they never get. The rainbow mafia and their strong arntactics to get their shit put through. Well you know what? Well not every gay person is involved in pedophilia. There's a large section of the rainbow mafia political movement. Now back some. You see this come up every now and again and the gay people freaking. No it's not us. I'm not a book a little guy. So I can understand but the fact of the matter is this is what's going on here. It is shit like this that has pushed the whole concept of Bougaloo. Now pay attention because this is important. The whole Bougaloo thing is a sia being run on you. Well maybe not you in particular but definitely being run on the carons and the islands and the weak-minded sheeple of the planet. The libertarians have a great expression. We want to take over the government and leave you alone. Kind of like the Bougaloo guys want to do too. They want to take over the government. Restructured back to the way it's supposed to be and then fuck back off to leave me alone land so the people leave them alone and I come back them to the wall on that. No problems with that concept because that's the way it should be. But as far as it's an organized movement of white supremacists, Nazi racist KKK members who hate America. No. No. That is exactly not what it is. Just relax folks. Unless you have a pink hair and wear a vagina hat and a screech every time something happens, run up the people in the street yelled them for not wearing a mask and do all the other things that basically the other sia up with are turning you into communists. If you rat on your neighbors because that's what a good epiracic does, then you get something to worry about the Bougaloo boys. It's the next iteration of epa. Okay, take of it that way. Ice cubes means fructy. Fuck. This is staring at now. But this is all part of the plan sia up. Don't fall for it. You know those Bougaloo guys might be your neighbors if they exist. So I'm just going to go with this. I think the Bougaloo man only comes for all the bad zoys and zurls who don't rat on your neighbors and wear their masks and eat their tofu kale, rainbow muckeletto, whatever the hell those friggin people eat. They're not terrorists. They're not even real. The fucking joke. I gotta go inside now, put my Hawaiian shirt and my battle keer on and go to the meat. Oh, folks, don't fall for these shit. Okay, we'll just terrorize you for the friggin profit margin. I'm gonna do headlines next. But this is too funny I had to. All right, remember if you are going to Bougaloo, can't press that Hawaiian shirt, it's got to have wrinkles in it. Make sure you match your Hawaiian camo to your environment. I haven't had a laugh like that forever to fight some fremency on the Nazis. Want to take over the, want to overthrow the government? No. I need to go and go friggin right out of the studio. I hate my friends.",
