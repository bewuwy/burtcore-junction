George did not deserve to die. Now if I said this about two to three days ago, all you would shout the same old things. He slashed that spy manager in the face. No, he didn't. He's a 31-time convicted criminal. No! No! Just cause your auntie's cousin's daughter's friend posted a fake paragraph from the RTE on Facebook. Doesn't make it reliable. It doesn't give you a civilian the right to determine whether or not somebody deserves to die. No matter how many people he threatened, no matter how many people he injured, the only person who is allowed to decide between the life and death of a so-called criminal is a judge. Now to mention, the death penalty doesn't exist in this country. So please, for your sake to avoid future embarrassment, every single racist word that comes out of your mouth should be backed up by stats and facts. I mean, not like we're gonna listen, but at least you look less stupid than you already are. You know? Listen, please, George.",
