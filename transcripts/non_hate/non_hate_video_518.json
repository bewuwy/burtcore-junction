They have killed more people on American soil and caused more damage on American soil than ISIS and al-Qaeda combined. And yet Black Lives Matters gets to burn down cities, loot, rob and pillage, and people tolerating it. That's ridiculous. We've shown stand for it. As Americans, we need to stand up and say when the Ford industry gives them $300 million, we say, fuck Ford. That's simple. They're not standing on the side of love. They're spreading hate, domestic terrorism. The 1964 civil rights riots are still going on as Black Lives Matters riots today. You know what we think about all that? The bottom American pride. Loving our people, white lives matter. Black lives aren't even contributing right now. All they're doing is tearing up, destroying. Destroying what again? Oh yeah, the nation we built. They robbed, they loot, they pillage. There are legal ways to demonstrate. White lives matter has over had over 20 some international rallies and national rallies. Not one law was violated. Black lives matter can't held any kind of protest or demonstration without looting, purging and murdering. They try to say that rape. Somehow rape is justified. Black lives down to it. Americans got to be proud of who we are and just say what it is. White lives matters. Black lives matters has denounced all lives matters and white lives matters as even matter. So if you agree that all lives matter, obviously white lives matter. And Black lives matters is a terrorist organization.",
