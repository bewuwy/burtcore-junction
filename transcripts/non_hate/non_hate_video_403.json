  "text": " A cone watch production starring Dan Bugley as the comedian, F. Steve Harvey, and Donald Trump. Cone watch. The official, the original, home for Cone Shandy. Find all the Cones you can handle at ConeWatch.com. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. So, D.L., I guess you are saying that Trump is the only president that takes pictures with celebrities. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. It's amazing to me. If Donald Trump cares about black people, he wouldn't have denigrated the president with those claims of birth arisen. He wouldn't have stoked fears and racist fears of saying this man is less than or is not one of us to become president. If Donald Trump cares about the concerns of black people, he wouldn't have in the debates talked about bringing back stop and frisk. Stop and frisk? Stop and frisk? Now that's a valid point. But D.L. is more concerned about his lover Obama than real black matters. Check out this love fest. Millions and millions whilst the president gave his farewell address to the nation, I think it was full of optimism. Optimism? Wasn't it President Obama's farewell speech? I think it was full of hope. Oh, again, are we talking about President Obama's farewell speech? I think it was full of nostalgia. I think it was the reason all the reasons that we loved him and followed him for eight years. If Donald Trump cared about black people, Jeff Sessions would most certainly not be his pick to head the Justice Department. Donald Trump takes pictures with black people. Having a comedian and a rapper and a football player out to talk about the concerns of the community. D.L. didn't president Obama meet with a rapper, Jay Z, a football player, a whole lot of them. And a comedian, you, if you still consider one. And a few booty shapers, Fergie and Beyoncé. All while denying the black caucus access to him and putting his bulldog, Reverend L. Shorpton on them if they dare step out of line. You know why you have a comedian and a rapper and a football player out to talk about the concerns of community? Because that's the position you used to seeing us in. You would rather see a football player, a rapper and a comedian. So what happens if a rapper, a football player, and a comedian enter an Obama inauguration party? The rapper's wife will show you her ASS. You'd rather have black people with football players, comedians and rappers than the president. You'd rather see us run the ball and run the country. That's why you do it. I ain't gonna never forget what you said about this man and how you got where you are. Some people might, but I never will. I'll never forget how you denigrated his family. I'll never forget how you stoke fears. Fuck you now and fuck you forever. Yeah, a really dumb, strong, tough destiny. Maybe he's upset that Trump is not his white daddy. So let's watch this cool, this is mama, and show love for his white daddy. I want to have one, I've got it to my mother. And she did the apple. She said this apple's rotten. Just like you are. And I laughed and I told him that story said, you know, right? You're gonna be something. And I'll never forget that. And I hope he's as proud of me as I... Get job, get job. Get job, get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. So this cool, this is mama and share some tears for his white daddy. Typical blind side, green mile, the hell, hidden figures, white savior, cool shit. But he's not through with black women. Let's wrap up with this cool clowning, black college girls. So he could get approval from another white daddy. We called him Hose and Navigator Hose and they weren't Hose. But it was some Navigator women on that team. Shut up, I'm gonna say it. I don't give a damn y'all like it or not. You know it's true. Them is some of the ugly women I ever seen in my home. Get the hell out of here. Call that bell. I don't want to be a cool no mo. I'm gonna say that here. Cool man, nigga. Listen to your boys and girls. I got something for you. Don't worry about getting no black man, little girl. Don't worry about getting no black woman, little boy. And when you go up, don't worry about your kids. You don't need to worry about that. All you need to do is do some girls with white folks. And a white folks love you. If they love you, you'll be our right child. You'll be with God. Corn watch. You'll fish you the original home for corn shaming.
