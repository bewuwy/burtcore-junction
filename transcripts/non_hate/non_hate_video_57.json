  "text": " I think it's primarily a misinterpretation, an intentional misinterpretation of Dr. Keane. His nonviolence was strategic. It wasn't that violence wasn't necessary. It was that we couldn't win with violence. We couldn't get our agenda accomplished with violence. America is showing us something totally different right now. It is saying we will not pay you any attention until you burn something down. And that's not our fault. If it was up to me, Glenn, if it was up to me, I would be somewhere writing a book right now. Exipping a mimosa, doing all the cosmopolitan things that we have all been accustomed to and programmed to desire and want. But America is signaling to us that we will not give you any attention. We will not pay any attention to your grievances unless you are burning something down. So the strategy inherently has to change. And then even still, I want to correct myself a little more. It wasn't until they saw the violence of bloody Sunday that mean, well, meaning liberals were actually kicked into gear to say, okay, we have to do something. So it really is a condemnation of the United States of America that in order for us to have any type of meaningful change, violence has to be attached to it. And maybe that's the curse of America being such a violent nation.",
