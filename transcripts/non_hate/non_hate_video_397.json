Ladies and gentlemen, gamers, autistic people, amputees, straight and gay, black and white, people who are bisexual, Mexican people, Asian people, Middle East, certain people, everybody that has been following this since the very beginning. Tonight is a very important night. Why? Because tonight is the night I say it. I, the Joker, have in my possession hundreds of N word passes. Tonight we're gonna use a voice. At any rate, a lot of people were afraid it wasn't gonna happen. But at this point it'd be more villainous if I didn't do it. Am I right? All right, here goes nothing. She sells, she sells by the sea show. See, she sells fuck whatever it's just one words, just one word. Let's ride. Anyone out there? Ladies and gentlemen of the internet, without further ado. Nigger! Not the black man! Oh, where are we going? Don't say it, Nigger! And just like that, my moment was taken away from me. Just when I thought my white privilege was going to extend to the furthest corners of the universe and finally envelop the one last thing that was denied access, the black man stopped me. Well, I guess we'll just have to wait until the next Joker movie comes out. Oh, where are we going?",
