  "text": " Koonwatch. The official, the original, home for Koonchanting. Find all the Koon's you can handle at koonwatch.com. I found myself back in my prayer room. I found my spirit very disturbed. Everybody is prepared for the final four March madness. Things that ran into newspapers have disturbed me. I'm trying to figure out if black lives really matter. Then in Chicago alone the murder rate is sort 72% in 2016. 88% in the first three months of 2016 compared to last year. I'm trying to ask the question if to the organization of black lives if they really matter then why not write it now. There was 141 murders this year. 82 murders last year at the same time. I'm trying to figure out in my mind why no one is playing attention to black men killing black men. Why we always find ourselves has the victims. And now we have the separation once again that we're being victimized because of one bad white cop, two bad white cops, three bad white cops, kill on the young black brother. But every day we have black on black crime killing each other. Police in Chicago reported 677 shoes this year. Last year it was 359 March murder rate rose by 29%. But we're not writing in the streets when black on black crime are killing each other. I'm trying to figure out how how the month of March there's more murders in the month of March in Chicago than there are days in the month 45 murders in the month of Chicago. There was 271 shoe incidents. I'm trying to stop the access one simple thing. When will we appreciate who we are? When will our skin color start paying attention to our own skin color? When will we stop crying that black lives matter because God says I am alpha and omega. I am creator of all and all come up under me with my spirit which means color means nothing. I am king. I will live this king but we have found our way distracted. We found our way distracted because things we're not paying attention to. The murders in 2015 and 2016 just the comparison to Chicago should be sad enough. 2015 there was 34 murders. 2016 that was 45. From January 1st to March 31st there was 82 murders in 2015 there was 141 in 2016. Let's just talk about the shoes. The shoes in 2015 there was 179. 2016 there was 271. January 1st to March 31st the shoes alone. 2015 there was 359. 2016 there was 677. The shoeed in victims in 2015 it was 204. In 2016 it's 319. From January 1st to March 31st it was 411 in 2015 the 677 murders in 2016 and I'm trying to hacks what's the problem. I was hacked if I was an elected official what would I do to stop some of this violence. I would put barrels on each corner I would give you 30 days to drop all illegal weapons in these barrels and if you found yourself going outside of that the moment I found you with a less 25 years mandatory there's no more having conversations because what's starting to happen now is we're starting to confuse our kids. Our kids don't know which way to walk the streets we got babies involved tomorrow being shot in the middle of the streets they're on the front porch and they're being shot we got a family of five to six sitting in the backyard having a barbecue and the whole tiger family gets executed but we keep screaming black lives matter if they really matter then let's do ourselves a favor let's stop kill it black folks let's take it way back to when we once was understood what slavery was all about slavery was about togetherness and I understand that we must overcome together not that we must separate ourselves to highlight our skin color if you want to highlight our skin color highlight the people that's doing the successful things in the communities that we should be highlight and then all athletics athletics come a dime a dozen but the impact of your journey and the things that we supposed to be doing you supposed to be leaving an impact to change people's lives one day God won't act how many super balls out one how many tackles I may I'm an interceptors I have you will ask the simple question how many lives have I changed all our comfort zone must be disturbed we got music now that kids can't listen to what their parents we got reading our shows that's showing things that kids have a way social media has took us way beyond what we're supposed to be we've done the long term thinking in our minds we've led kids now dictate what they can do and who that can be and what they will ultimately be I found myself disturbed whether I'm right or wrong there's facts there's numbers men and women lie but numbers don't numbers don't lie and what's going on in Chicago right now if you write music change your thought process change your language stop insulting women we all got our struggles there's nothing about me that's perfect I'm a struggling man every day of my life to walk the right path I haven't figured it all out yet but I figured out enough to say that there's something and I'm supposed to pass along that don't go through my same struggles let's write something different let's give these let's give these lost children something to really envision I cried today to say I'm not a perfect man and I have my failures just like anyone else but I guess the question is are you helping or you serving you can help anybody you can give your money away to help any calls but to serve to serve you must come out of your comfort zone there's too many brothers killing each others and brothers if I had one message for you man stop and check the pulse of the person before you pull a trick and realize that they are alive and everybody you hurt you will be accounted for man I'm talking I'm I'm man foolish people on social media the things that they say that's pure ignorance evil exists social media has become the devil's playhouse because it has foolish ignorant people who can hide behind captions of children and pictures and funny things and insult people who's actually doing something but one day we will all be held accountable and brothers if nobody else wants scream to you I'm a scream to you I know black lives matter because I'm a black man but men stop killing each other man we got to put these guns down scot go thoughts more Miami men and ain't that hard man man you got to be okay we're earning the right living man he's supposed to be easy man's days on this earth will be short and filled with trouble but right now man we we're losing the battle a third of the African-American population is behind bars 50% are behind bars because they took the life of another black man sooner or later black man if we don't change what we're doing not only will our kids not have a future but we might find ourselves extinct listen to your boys and girls I got something for you don't worry about getting no black man little girl don't worry about getting no black woman little boy and when you go up don't worry about your kids you don't need to worry about that all you need to do is do some girls with white folks and a white folks love you if they love you you'll be all right child you'll be with God the official the original home for cone shaming find all the coins you can handle at kuhmwatch.com",
