  "text": " Some updates here in regards to the case involving Epstein and all the associates around him. We're finding out today that he has been denied bail. He's going to be forced to stay in this tiny cell until his hearing. And they're saying that they're preparing here for a dump of information. They're saying that this massive document dump is going to be imminent in that the associates of this man should prepare for the worst. Some people that have been caught going to his places have been trying to deny any association with him trying to say, yeah, why I know him may have went there just to say hi or hang out once or twice was invited, but nothing, you know, bad went down. But that's what many say when other things have happened behind the curtain. And this is why he is finally getting taken down a lot of people are nervous because they feel that this is ultimately going to lead to a lot of names being dropped. Now let me remind everybody if you don't recall, this is a big one. Don't forget this. Bill Clinton's name keeps getting brought up, right? But you have got to remember that the judge overseeing this whole thing was appointed by Bill Clinton. Don't forget that. It's pretty key in this whole thing. So go back to a costa that just said he was stepping down. A costa was supposed to prosecute Epstein and gave him a very lenient sentence last time. And when they asked him, well, why did you do this? His answer was that he belonged to intelligence. That's what he was told. He was reportedly told that Epstein belonged to intelligence. That is interesting as well. I will update on this Friday night underground world news live. Make sure to join us 9 p.m. Eastern. I will leave links below and also make sure to join us over on D live as well. I love y'all.",
