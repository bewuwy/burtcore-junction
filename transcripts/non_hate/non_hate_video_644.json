Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. While men who caught and sang the sun in flight and learned too late, they greeded it on its way. Do not go gentlemen to that good night. Brave men near death who've seen with blinding sight.
