  "text": " Arno McAllis knows better than most, the mind of a far right-wing white supremacist. He says he was one. I had been violent since I was a little kid and hate was just like another part of the rush. And that's who I was when I heard white power skinhead music that told me the reason I was violent and the reason I was hateful was because I was a white warrior. In the late 80s, McAllis was a founding member of what became the largest racist skinhead organization in the world. He was also the lead singer of a white power metal band. McAllis left his life of hate behind in 1994 after becoming a single parent. A second friend of mine was shot and killed in a street fight after a concert my band had played and by that point I had lost count of how many friends had went to prison. So it finally hit me that if I didn't change my ways death or incarceration was going to take me from my daughter. But his past would soon come back to haunt him. In 2012, a white supremacist, someone who had joined the gang that McAllis formed, went to this seek temple on the outskirts of Milwaukee and shot seven people dead. As I'm going to the temple that morning, we started to get notifications that there was white supremacist inside the temple and at that time I knew that both my parents were inside. Hardeeb Kaleckas father and the president of the temple, Satwant Singh Kaleckas, was among those that died. Six weeks after the attack, Kalecka contacted McAllis, looking for answers. The meeting proved to be fruitful. The pair realized they could work together to help find solutions to hate. They decided to form Surf to unite, a group that works to divert young people away from violent extremist ideologies. The habit of white supremacy is not going to be easy for us to change. And it's going to take these tectonic plates to really shift and move. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center's annual year in HATE and Extremism report, the number of hate groups has increased by 55 percent since 2017. Going by the definition that hate is a willful denial of compassion, the answer to hate, I believe, is compassion.",
