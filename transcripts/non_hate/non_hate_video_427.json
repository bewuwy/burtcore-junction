I don't know, that's a good question. No, that doesn't sound really correct to me. Wait a second, it takes one hour to build a batch of cookies and you have 15 ovens, probably in four different kitchens right doing 24 hours a day for five years, how long would it take to get to 6 million? Hmm. I don't know, it certainly wouldn't be five years, right? The math doesn't seem to add up there. None of it really adds up, none of it really makes sense. This crazy cookie analogy, 6 million cookies, now I don't buy it. That's all irony, I'm an irony bro, that's all irony.",
