  "text": " Lord is the first time call out of Illinois Lord. Thank you for calling you on the air Hey, good morning Jesse. Oh I'm doing fine. I just want to say when I first heard you a long time ago I used to think to myself. I said man, this guy he's these are cool. He's awkward time But as I started to listen to you more I started to see how much since you made Amazing and what have you realized from the sense that I make? Basically I realized that Right now I'm in a fallen state and the reason why I'm calling is because I'm asking for advice I haven't I haven't seen my father in four years and I've been angry with him for over 20 years And I just want to know how to go about forgiving him as you've been talking about and why have you been angry at him for 20 years? What did he do to you? Basically We just ever since I was a child we never had a good relationship. We are Often he would often go overboard with any type of discipline or anything like that and Harvard resentment that he favored my my younger brothers More than he did me. So that's why I had always had that anger at me and And you mean as that of him gone overboard with our discipline? I Will basically a lot of times he would tell me that I was a sorry excuse for a son or that out of all his guns and I discussed in him so You know stuff like that that would just make me angry are you the oldest? Yes, and are you the closest to your mother? Well, we at cl- yes That's why he felt that way you identify with your mother and he probably saw you as being a weak boy Because you act like your mother and he Judge you because he you act like the woman that he hated and Go to him find him and Let him know I'm sorry for resent you for that. I understand now You act like your mother you identified. That doesn't make it right for what he did to you the way he treated you But he hated your mother because he married to his mother his mother Your mother is his mother Because man married women that like their mothers because they resent their mothers and then when they get with them They become like little boys and if they can't get past the mother they become violent or they start to cheat or they leave or All of the above so you identify with your mother. That's why he did that to you All right, make sense and then just let him know I Did understand why you treated me so badly. I'd now understand it was a right the way you treated me But I'm wrong for holding it against you. I realize you can help yourself Okay I'll go ahead and do that. I just have to basically make my way down to Virginia so that I can do that Yeah, I don't argue with him if he agrees fine if he doesn't find If he explains to you explains to you what happened that'll be good But forgive him lord and your whole life will change you come back to yourself and there's nothing like being you You're gonna have perfect peace within All right, thank you very much Jesse. Let me know how it goes. I will okay, but I wish you well All right, right now amazing huh Absolutely Amazing",
