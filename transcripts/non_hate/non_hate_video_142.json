Now remember folks, next news is being heavily censored so please make sure you're still subscribed to the channel, make sure you're still getting your notifications. If you're new to the channel please check out the newsletter in the description below and remember folks we've also been taken out of the suggested videos from time to time so please we're now counting on you to make sure that not only you continue to watch the Next News Network but that you're sharing it with others so that we can continue to get the word out on the true news. Now let's get to your story. According to Trent Baker from BrightBart Report, Senator Chris Kuhn's Delaware Democrat on Friday discussed his support of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former vice president Crazy Joe Biden over the likes of Senator Elizabeth High Cheekbones, Focahontis, Warren from the LyreWaffa tribe and of course who could forget Bernie Breadline Sanders. Kuhn said that on CNBC's Squawk Box that he is backing Joe Biden because he supports economic growth in the United States and Biden will be solving the problems for average Americans and working to bring the country together. Wow, what a statement that is. Good and roll the split. It's hyperbole. It's hyperbole obviously but I mean any pro private sector, free market pro capitalists that that the specter of a of a Warren or Sanders presidency is absolutely horrifying. Well I think Joe Biden would put us back into our place in the we're just talking about Warren or Sanders. I wouldn't walk into any room with any world leader. Right. Say great to see you again. He said that he's supposedly off the record. He told some private sector leaders that you know with me you don't have as much to worry about as you would with him. And then he gets hammered for that because the woke left is like this guy is going to be in bed with you know what we want growth in this country. That's what that's what's produced jobs. The corporations that create the jobs. Yeah, that you can't worry about. This is a famous Hubert Humphrey quote. You can't worry about the working man and not worry about for whom he's going to work. You got to be attentive to the fact that without growth, we're fighting over a shrinking pot. So at the end of the day, I'm supporting Joe with a whole heart of an Iowa within this weekend. I'm optimistic about how he can actually solve the problems facing our country and bring us together. The best way as we were talking about earlier, the best way for us to confront a peer competitor in China is to be America again to legislate to solve problems to deal with drug pricing. The opening of the U.S. it alone and I think Joe, are you sitting alone at lunch now? I've actually got a full lunch table of folks who just don't go on Twitter. Okay, I don't know. I think you know even after this interview, I think you're going to get some dirty looks down there. Are you headed back there today? Maybe he said quote, we cannot be the party of free stuff. That doesn't work. Well, obviously it doesn't work and it's interesting that you can see a Democrat agreeing with that. Americans realize this and that's why everyone is hopefully not going to vote for whoever the Democratic nominee ends up being because there is no such thing as free stuff. Everybody pays for it one way or the another, whether it's increased taxes, whether it's taking from the taxpayers and giving it to the ones that aren't working or more than anything else, you're freedom. You're always going to pay for it folks. Those are my thoughts. What are yours? Put them down in the comments below. Give us a like, give us a share, continue to watch. The next news network. I'm Josh Burnt, seeing Phil and Infra Gary French. If you want more about me, check out the Josh Burnt's Teen Show on YouTube and we'll see you on the next report. Don't go anywhere. I want you to imagine if you had received a personal invitation to invest just $50 an Uber when it was a startup. Well, on IPO day, you could have made $248,000. That same $50 invested in Amazon before IPO could have made you over $7 million. Mike Marcula was Apple's first angel investor. On IPO day, his windfall was already 220 plus percent, 220 plus thousand percent. But that was only when Apple was worth 1.8 billion. Think about how much Marcula's net worth grew as Apple blazed a path to becoming the first $1 trillion company in the US history. And without him, iPhones, Apple watches, iPads and other devices we use in our daily lives may have never been invented. Now, look at these surprising returns from these popular startup companies. Some earning 583,264 percent return on investment friends. What would you rather be? The angel investor or IPO investor? Now, the choice is clear as day. How would you feel if you could get in on the ground floor of the hottest startups this year that everybody is fighting over?
