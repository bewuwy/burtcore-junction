  "text": " What is up YouTube? John Kristani here is going to show you how to build an email list for marketing without a website. No website needed for this in under 10 minutes. I'll be going over a few things with you today showing you free email marketing program that you can use. I'll also be showing you how you can create a sign up form that's hosted on its own landing page even if you don't have a website. There's no need to register a website to make this happen. I'll also be showing you how to create your email marketing campaign and I'll be giving you a free bonus at the end to help you get started making money with email marketing. So stay tuned, keep watching, let's get into it. But once again, this is going to be a pretty hot video because we're going to be going over how to build an email list without even having a website. So this is pretty exciting. And also we're going to do it in under 10 minutes. Can you start the time? Yeah. Okay, cool. So we got the timer started. First go into the free email marketing program and the free email marketing program we will be using. Let's go over to my computer is called MailChimp. Now MailChimp is free to sign up for free to use. And as you can see right here, MailChimp all in one marketing platform. You just click on that in Google. I couldn't find an affiliate program for them otherwise I would have put an affiliate link below but there might be a link in the description. And what you do is you just click this button in the top right corner like all programs sign up for free right up there to get started. Now keep in mind there's a lot of additional resources that they have available for you to learn email marketing and I'm going to be going over the basics. So you can always go deeper in in their resource file. Now the first thing you do once you get signed in the MailChimp is you need to create an audience for basically an audience is kind of like a list or a segment whatever you want to call it. But you'll go up here to the top left corner and you'll click create. Now once you're logged in the MailChimp the first thing you'll do is you'll need to create an audience which is also known as an email list. So in order to create an email list or an audience we'll scroll down in the main camp main area you just click this button and it'll say audience and write down here it says create a list. So we're going to want to click that button right there to start creating our email list. So we'll click create a list and in here we'll want to say what our audience name is. So let's just say um I don't know Tito diet. I recently have been on the Tito diet you know eating lots of nuts vegetables and meat no carbs lost 15 pounds in the last two months 15 pounds in two months so pretty cool. I was getting a little big there for a while. I saw some of you commenters making fun of it. So you'll set up your audience name here and then you'll do your default from address. So let's just say I'm John Robert Christani at gmail.com. Everybody send me emails. I love getting personal emails from all you and if you need money anybody who sends me an email asking for money I give money to. Okay so default from name we'll just say Christani and you set up your information right down here okay and then you just click save. So we have an audience now we have an audience named Keto diet. Now the next step that we actually take is we're going to actually need to create a landing page. So what you need to do up here is we're going to go up and click create and then we will go down here towards says landing page and this is going to be a page that allows you to collect emails on it to go into your list. So let's call our landing page name Keto LP LP stands for landing page and then we click begin right here. Now here we've arrived at a spot where we can select a number of different styles. It depends on I don't know what do you think looks best. Let's just say this wild country looks like the best fit. So we might say get fit and lose weight and we will change this so we click that and then the button text will say get free information sent to your email now. Free information sent to your email now. Learn how I lost 15 pounds in two months on the Keto diet. Maybe I want to make a font Georgia and maybe I want to make it a little bit bigger so that it shows up bigger. You can do a lot of things with this maybe want to make it bold or a callicized or underlined. Whatever you want to do you can do and even if you want it to change the picture you could change the image to something else. We're not going to do all of that right now but the point being you can have a lot of fun with these templates and customize them how you want. What you do once you're done is you can click save and close right in the lower corner. So to finish it setting up you need to add a page title and you need to create a URL for your page. So we're just going to add a page title lose weight on the Keto diet and then we will add URL we'll click this final step right there. So we'll just say use MailChimp domain and we will say Keto diet then we will click save. So make sure once again you want to click use MailChimp domain this way you can do this without having your own website and you can collect emails which you can mark it to voila. Here we go. So here's our page and here's our link and you really want to save this link because this is pretty important right here. This link will go to your page. So you have a free web page right now you have a free web page that people can sign up for and opt in on. Okay so now we finish all of the things all we need to do now is actually click publish. So I'm going to save I'm going to save this URL and I'm going to click publish and high five it says our landing pages on the web. So let's check it out and here we go look our web pages already live we can enter in you know let's just say I'm going to say Henry Royal at gmail.com we could say subscribe success you've been added to the audience and if we go in our campaign builder here we can actually go under the dashboard and we can see well it might take a second to update but basically it will show us that we just added a subscriber and we have a web page we have an email list we can mail to we have everything we need to actually start marketing now how do you actually start marketing to people though. So last step is you'll want to go under create right here and you would do design and send regular or automated emails to your subscribers and from there you go through the step by step process of being able to create that. So that should have been under 10 minutes that may have even been under five but in that you just learn how to build an email list set it up without a web site in under 10 minutes and it's four marketing meaning the people are opting in it's going to be GDPR compliant you can market to these people the difference with marketing is they opt in if they don't opt in to be an email list you're technically violating spam laws when you send an email to them. So we're using MailChimp there's a lot of other email service providers I personally recommend send grid send grid is first all it's run by a freaking animal like just genius Isaac he's amazing and if you haven't seen interviews of Isaac Salgata went to UC Riverside not too far from where I live in Malibu well it's in Southern California he's amazing onto manure he's got amazing vision and he's built an amazing company which does email better than any other company on the internet but MailChimp is great to start you build a sign up form you build a landing page sign up form and landing page website without having to register your own website and you created an email campaign you're going to give you a bonus I said I was going to give you a bonus and the bonus is I want to work with you I actually want to work with you I want to make money together I want to be partners and what I'd like to do is I'd like to encourage you to build email lists helping people learn ways they can earn money from home because this is a big problem there are a lot of people still going to jobs a lot of people doing long commutes to work every day and frustrated and don't like it there's a lot of parents still telling their kids to be nurses doctors lawyers accountants and a lot of kids that go into those professions and learn that they hate it I want to show people how they can make money from home and I want you to help me and you're going to get 90% of the commissions and I'm going to get 10% I still end up making out alright my JV page and information on how to be an affiliate working with me my editors will post a video top right corner of this video and also there will be information on how to sign up as an affiliate with me through click bank digi store and other networks in the links in the description I'd love to work with you and I'd love for us to make money together and the bonus is going to be on my JV page which is my affiliate page I'm giving away a dozen free emails dozen emails which you can actually use to send to people that work that help them that motivate them to take action and join my training program and you earn money I earn money everybody earns money together so I'd like to work with you and I hope you like working with me and I commit to providing you training every single day for very least the rest this year to help you learn how to make money with the internet so make sure you murder that subscribe button just hit it really hard and also hit that notification bell and make sure you enable all notifications like this video if you have questions ask them below I'm not going to answer them but I encourage people who have been following me for a while subscribers to answer other people's questions or if you have aren't a subscriber help answer other people's questions we're building a community here we have four different communities which you can be a part of learning how to make money online again we're all working together I want to create an ecosystem where we all make money and all learn from each other we have a Reddit if you love Reddit if reddits your favorite go reddit we have a discord chat channel we have a forum and we have Facebook group whichever community group you like the most say go discord or go forum or go Facebook group or the point being I'm trying to create a community here I want us to work together I want you selling my product I want to be paying you money but I need you to do your work and you need to set this stuff up and you need to check out my free traffic methods playlist which I'll have my editors link to above as well and go through the videos I show you how to get people to that page because I showed you how to build an email list but I didn't show how to get people to it and those are in my free traffic methods videos so you want to watch those videos to learn how to get people to go to that one to learn how to get people to sign up and once they sign up you have 12 free emails in which you can send them to help encourage them to take that scary step it's scary because we've been told our entire lives that we have to commute to work that we have to work out you know in America it's a good job in India it's it's to become an engineer in the Philippines it's to become a nurse in Germany it's to go into finance every culture in Iran it's to become a lawyer or a doctor every culture has their thing that they want their kids to be but many of these professions are boring, nepotistic, dying and they make you hate your life don't do that doesn't make sense I make millions of dollars every year just doing teaching and doing marketing for other companies and you can too so help me help you take action a day subscribe like the video and comment below looking forward to talking to you soon",
