  "text": " The sample of lunar soil brought back has a big impact on the Soviets' understanding of lunar geology. The results of the analysis shock Soviet geologists. It looked like something had happened to the soil in an area of the moon that was supposedly undisturbed for billions of years. What could it have been? Test on the sample confirmed that the soil used to be buried deep underground. The Soviet Union brought it to the surface. The Soviets know that the Americans haven't been to this part of the moon. They think this is their turf. So they have to face up to the question, who the heck's been disturbing the lunar surface here? Could someone else have landed on the moon before the US and Russia? I have heard that Germans developed a moon rocket before they were defeated in 1945. A fact from NASA's own records. The Germans had a very advanced space exploration program. The Nazis were leaders in the rocketry industry. And they had people like Warner von Braun. The German aerospace engineer, Werner von Braun, is the founding father of rocket science. We're von Braun, was a genius. They've been a Nazi, but he was a genius. And was able to design systems that, to this day, are still astounding to us. During World War II, the Nazi regime asked von Braun to develop the V2 rocket, the first man-made craft to reach space. NASA and their Russian counterparts both know that this Nazi super-weapon was a key step in the development of their own moon rockets. We would not have been able to land on the moon if it hadn't been for the Germans. Damn right. The first American rocket was based on V2 technology. The first Russian rocket was essentially just a V2. How difficult is it to believe that the Nazis pushed their technology just that little bit further?",
