  "text": " Hey people, this is a story of how I learned to cure my coon dog from COVID. It's a coon dog, is a dog that'll here run up a coon up the wrong tree. And the wrong tree is a tree that that coon doesn't have a hole in it so he can't hide. And so these dogs is trying to run out in the woods and tree a coon and sound off. And then the hunter will come and shoot that coon down. And it makes coon skin hats. And if you ever eat a coon, you'll know the real reason why they like the coon. It's like the best roast beef you ever had. And so it's been going on for a long time and most joe coon hunters, they weren't really highly educated. So 30 years ago I was living in Old River, Shanny. And girl across the river brought me this big beautiful black puppy. He looked to be like a black lab but we knew the parent parents and it was actually a road Asian ridge back in in coyote mix. And I had spent a lot of time with that dog training it. I wasn't a coon hunter but I was teaching him party tricks and he was the most obedient dog. Everybody in town knew that dog. Anyway I went, the kids would run up and they all knew his name. I didn't know how but everybody knew my dog. And so he was about a nine months to a year and he had packed a cup of times during training. So I brought it to the vet. He was a really good dog and he went through all this checkup and she was just loving him. And took some blood and she came back in later and she held my hand. And told me that my dog had heartworms. And I said how much is this going to cost? So she went to explain in the life cycle of heartworms to me. And she explained how that the heartworms live in deer, out in the field and they draw blood out of that deer. And it'll have these micro fill high heartworms. Little tiny little tiny ones that'll fit up in that syringe. And it and it'll bring them and when it went and stuck it in your dog sometimes it let some of that blood back out and those little micro fill high come out. And then they go through a life cycle of growing inside your dog. And so they breed and so you have many different sizes. You know you have the tiny babies and you have them growing. You have them growing until they're five, four or five foot long. They'll attach there in the heart like a hookworm. And you know the heart will pump that blood and they'll hang back. You know the heart pumps that blood to the lungs first. So that's why they start packing they get a little cough. And then you know that worm gets so long he's old and starts to break off you know. After that blood goes to the lungs and it pumps through the brain and it goes back through the cycle and and they dissolve and and come out in the feces. And it's a really ugly sight the way she explains it to you. And I says yeah but you know what's it going to cost me to cure this. And and she squeezed my hand and she said $2,000. And I was living here on the river shanty so I kind of shook her hand loose. And I told her that me and my dog just aren't that attached. She had let me know that you know they were only in that first second stage they were small still. And the price even goes up to bigger they get. So I went back home and went went the next door to the bait shop. If you don't know what a bait shop is it's it's like a bar room on a river. And except sometimes they can sell you some worms. Might even have some hooks or sinkers there. And I was telling the girl that operates the bait shop that about it and she says you know my boyfriend he takes care of his coat or dogs he knows something about that. So I was back at my place later on that day and this guy come by he looked about like this except a little meaner and uglier. He looked real country and she apparently had told him and he got on the top to me about it. And so he told me he says you know we ain't got a whole lot of money you know with country boys and they couldn't we don't have a whole lot of cash we take care of our own dogs. He says I'm gonna tell you how how we do it it's the same way that the veterinarians do it. He says uh go to the co-op and ask him for some cattle warmer this I've a mack injection. I don't I don't think they had all the others back there anyway. So get your ball at I have a mack and they'll get you some syringes that go with it. And he says get you some seven and one shot while you're there for parvo and get him a couple hundred pound warmer pills and go through the regular routine you know you give him the seven one and you give him a week and you give him a hundred pound worth of warmer pills however much your dog weighs they'll uh they might if your dog weighs seven it might give you a fifty in a twenty and uh and you just go through uh you know give it to him and then give him a couple weeks and then and then do it again and what you're doing is you're you're killing you're killing the big ones in the small ones you know they breed in that time you miss some during the breeding weather in a egg cycle you miss them so you let them grow up big enough before that they have time and breed again and kill them again and that's why you you wait that certain amount of time between them and he says the the trick is you don't want to kill all these worms because that heart when they die that heart is going to pump them to the lungs and then they're going to go straight to the brain and they're going to give that dog a stroke and kill it he says the trick is to just kill the smallest ones first he's to give them a little bit of dose and you're killing the small ones first and you can go through time take your time until so just a feud you know just some of them die off slowly and they don't all go into the brain all at one time he says way up your dog and however much your dog weighs the injection is going to be that many millimeters and so luckily my dog weighed a hundred pounds and it made this really easy but you have to do a little more math if your dog's different your dogs bigger smaller pieces start with a dime just 10% he says don't for a couple days don't feed your dog any fatty foods and you know if it's hot out right on the side where it's cool you know don't stress your dog and give my dime so my dog's first dose was just at this 10 here and so this old syringe got a needle on it because you're going to have to draw it out a little rubber top on the bottle but you don't inject it into the dog you just unscrew the end and just feed it to them in the mouth and it must taste good because you know the dogs hate to take medicine they know it's up but after I would give it to him come back and try to lick this syringe and get it all out so it must taste good and just keep your eye on your dog and make sure he's doing all right you know if something should happen then you have to rush to the vet and tell him what you did and then you know just give him 10 days 10 days 14 days and you just you know you killed the smallest ones the big ones that little dose didn't affect him and so 14 later 14 days later 10 14 days later you double that dose up you know so then I brought it to 20 and do the same thing you know for a couple days before that don't feed them a lot of real fatty foods make sure they're cool not out in the heat stressing and if your dog didn't lay down and get real sick the first time you know a lot of times if they got bad heartworms they'll get sick the first time if you didn't lay down and get real sick the first time you're probably going to be all right just going out throughout the process you know and and raise it up to to a 20 then in the second week so it was it was uh you know the the first week I give him a warmer peel I give him 10 days and then I give him a warmer peel and you're trying to kill all the little smaller pair sites before you go attack this big problem and give it a week and give him a 71 injection and then 71 injection you know it's going to inject in under the skin and uh and then give him 10 days the weeks and give him a booster if you haven't never give him a 71 before you'll have to do a booster on it but um I've I've always given my dogs are 71 and their warmer pills always did that myself and so there's no need for the booster so um I give it 10 days and I give him the 10% and uh it barely hit him you know he didn't he didn't really lay down a lot he didn't make him real sick I knew it was okay like she told me it was all it was at the lowest degree there weren't real big and so 10 14 later days later I raised up to a 20 in same process 10 14 days later I raised up to a 40 same process 10 14 days later I raised up to a 80 same process and then 10 days later I give him the full dose at the 100 and then um you know after that if if you have bad mosquito problem you could just give him this full dose you know the their full dose my 100 pound dog took the to the hundred million and you could just do that every month and if you don't have the mosquitoes you know year round you can just wait till the mosquitoes is there and you can you can wait two months you know and give him a half dose one month and then a and a full dose two weeks later you know you can skip a couple months give him a half dose or you could wait a year when the mosquitoes come back around and start at the dime the 20 and go through the routine but this is uh this is your your heart warmer you know you don't have to give him the heart warmer you really don't this kills everything you don't have to give him any of the other shots any this kills every warm every parasite you know the reason you're wanting to kill all these worms in your cattle is so they eat and get fat you know you don't want them wasting the food you don't want hook worms and you puppy you know you feed your puppies forever and they never get any weight because the hookworms is eating all the nutrition they get no nutrition on their food so kounhunt ain't the same as it used to be uh now they have shows where they don't shoot the kounh and uh they just rate the dogs and and the winner gets all kind of cash and prizes uh and i've heard 25,000 in hook sometimes so about 15 years ago i was building a barn for a local vet marion and uh i went by his office in a gallon jar up on the counter with the dogs hard in it and it was just full of of four or five foot long heartworms and i knew that was my chance to get the girl to talk you know because uh in their hypocritic oath they can't say anything about it and so i told her the story of how i treated my dog when he had heart worms and i told her the whole story exactly how i did it and all she could say was that should have worked you know it's the same when you go down to bi of mech they're not going to tell you that that's what it's for they can't tell you that it's illegal form it's the same reason that uh they take movies down and so uh i posted the movie the other day about this doctor core he was uh two days ago he's in a senate hearing and he told all about all the studies and how this ivomech is the miracle treatment for COVID and that movie lasted less than 20 minutes they pulled it down but i put it up here on my hidden history on a bit shoot you can see the movie here and i leave the link underneath here so my dog had lived uh another 13 years after that he was loved by all i treated uh many other people's dogs that i knew was was too poor to treat their dogs for heart worms and i never had a problem i haven't lost a dog yet i still do it today and koon hunting has changed since like i said they don't even shoot the koon much anymore now you got a lot of doctors and lawyers running koon dogs for prestige you know just to say they won so i'm going to investigate further into this and see if i can find a human dosage but i would bet it's the same as the dog a million for a for a pound all right i'ma cut this off here a good day",
